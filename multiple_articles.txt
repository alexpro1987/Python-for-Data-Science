data Globally, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) are among the most widely produced and used nanomaterials (NMs). The estimated global annual production of TiO2NPs is currently near 12,500 tons (1,2). This value is expected to reach 2.5 million metric tons by 2025 (3). Owing to their unique physico-chemical properties, TiO2NPs are used in diverse applications including consumer, industrial and biomedical fields. The extensive synthesis and pervasive use of TiO2NPs has resulted in unprecedented avenues for human exposure to these materials in the environment and through the use of consumer products. Exposure to TiO2NPs via inhalation leads to pulmonary inflammation, emphysema and lung injury in experimental rodents (4,5). Due to their nanosize, TiO2NPs penetrate deep into the highly vascularised areas of lungs and persist in lungs for weeks after the last exposure (6). In addition, TiO2NPs deposited in rodent lungs translocate to blood, liver, heart, lymph nodes, spleen and other organs (7–10). These results imply that exposure to TiO2NPs can negatively impact health of the organisms exposed.
index 0
data Acute pulmonary responses in rodents exposed to TiO2NPs are greatly influenced by their primary particle size (11–14), surface area, surface charge, surface coatings (15–18) and their crystalline structure (19,20). These results suggest that a combination of physico-chemical properties influence the pulmonary outcome of exposure to TiO2NPs. It is yet to be determined whether one of these properties is more important than the others and whether the underlying mechanisms of the observed pulmonary responses differ by the properties of TiO2NPs.
index 1
data We have previously employed toxicogenomics tools to characterise the pulmonary transcriptomic responses in mice exposed via inhalation (21) or instillation to TiO2NPs of different sizes, surface coatings and TiO2NPs embedded in paint (6). We have shown that all types of TiO2NPs induce pulmonary inflammation via the same mechanisms; however, the severity of response varies with their specific properties (22). The transcriptomic studies discussed above were limited to few TiO2NP types and for now, it is not clear whether the results from those studies can be generalised to all TiO2NP variants. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of lung toxicogenomic responses in mice exposed individually to six different types of TiO2NPs varying in size, crystalline structure and surface coatings to further our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of TiO2NP-induced lung responses. Acute, subchronic and chronic post-exposure time points were included along with a range of doses. The TiO2NP types included anatase TiO2NPs of 8, 20, and 300nm, mixed anatase/rutile TiO2NP of 20nm and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm with hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces. Mice were exposed via single intratracheal instillation to 18, 54, 162 or 486 µg/animal doses of individual TiO2NPs. Although the 486 µg/animal dose is physiologically high, it was included in the study to determine whether exposure to TiO2NPs results in lung pathology at higher doses. Samples were collected at 1, 28 and 90 days post-exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cellularity, histopathology, particle localization in lungs (by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Cytoviva nanoscale hyperspectral microscopy) were assessed at all three post-exposure time points. Global gene expression profiles were generated for all doses, at Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure time points. Pathway tools were employed to characterise the molecular pathways perturbed following exposure to TiO2NPs. Disease similarity tools were employed to determine whether the altered gene expression profiles are associated with any known lung disease.
index 2
data A set of six TiO2NPs of varying physico-chemical properties were investigated in the current study (Table 1): anatase TiO2NPs of three different sizes, 8, 20 and 300nm (aTiO28,
aTiO220 and aTiO2300), mixed anatase and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm (raTiO220) and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm with hydrophilic [rTiO220 (HY)] or hydrophobic [rTiO220 (HP)] surfaces. All six particles were obtained from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development through the sponsorship program. The aTiO28 is commercially known as Hombikat UV100 and is available through Sachtleben Chemie GmbH, Germany. It is used as a semiconductor catalyst in photocatalytic applications. The aTiO220 and aTiO2300 are commercially available as PC105 and tiona, respectively, from Cristal Global (http://www.cristal.com), whereas, raTiO220 is commercially known as P25 and is available from Evonik Degussa GmbH, Germany. The rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) are known as UV Titan M262 and UV Titan M212, respectively, and are available from Sachtleben Chemie GmbH, Germany. The selected anatase TiO2NPs are used in building materials and in air purification systems for their photocatalytic activity. They are also used in self-cleaning fabrics, glass and other products. The raTiO220 NPs are commonly used as catalyst carriers, active components for photocatalytic reactions and as heat stabilizers in silicone rubber. The two functionalised TiO2NPs—rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP)—are used in skin and sun care products. The hydrophobic rTiO220 (HY) is also used in manufacturing waterproof and stain resistant textiles (23,24).
index 3
data The particles aTiO28, raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) have been extensively characterised by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and reported in Rasmussen et al. (25). In brief, aTiO28 and raTiO220 are relatively pure. Negligible amount of silica (Si), aluminium (Al), and sulphur (S) was identified in aTiO28. The rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) contain 91.3% and 92.7% Ti, respectively, and are suggested to contain relatively higher levels of Al, Si, and S. In addition, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis shows the presence of dimethicone (~2 weight %) coating on rTiO220(HY) and glycerol (~1–2 weight %) on rTiO220(HP), which contribute to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature of the rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP), respectively (25). Extensive characterisations of aTiO220 and aTiO2300 have not been reported. The details of the particle characterisations are summarized in Table 1.
index 4
data A pilot study was conducted to assess the dispersion of TiO2NPs in MilliQ water, 2% serum or mouse BALF. The results revealed (data not shown) that with the exception of raTiO220, all other TiO2NPs are best dispersed in MilliQ water. Thus, MilliQ water was used as particle dispersion vehicle for the experiments. For the purposes of consistency, the raTiO220 was also prepared in MilliQ water. A stock suspension of 6mL for each type of TiO2NPs at a concentration of 12.15mg/mL was made in MilliQ water. The particle suspension was dispersed by sonicating the samples using an S-450D sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT, USA) at 10% amplitude for a total of 16min on ice with alternating 10s pulses and pauses in an enclosed chamber.
index 5
data The size and agglomeration state of TiO2NPs in dry state were analysed using TEM analysis (Tecnai G2 F20 FETEM, FEI, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) at the Nano Imaging Facility of Carleton University. Samples were stirred in filtered ethanol and sonicated for 5min (ultrasonic water bath). A drop of this suspension was deposited on copper TEM grids (200-mesh copper grids covered with Formvar/Carbon film (Agar Scientific, Essex, UK), air-dried and analysed using TEM.
index 6
data The stock suspensions of the TiO2NPs at a concentration of 50 µg/ mL were prepared in MilliQ water and sonicated as described above. Prior to the dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis with the Nicomp 380 ZLS instrument (Nicomp Particle Sizing Systems, Santa Barbara, CA, USA), samples were manually mixed and diluted 1 in 100 with 0.22 µm-filtered MilliQ water and were sonicated again for 5min in a water bath sonicator. The DLS instrument was calibrated using 90nm and 240nm standard calibration beads, and the analysis was conducted according to the DLS manufacturers’ instructions. The value of the number-weighted particle size distribution was calculated assuming that the particles are spheres of uniform density that scatter light according to classical Mie theory (26).
index 7
data Five-to-seven-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were housed in autoclaved cages with a 12-h light–dark cycle. All mice were given food and water ad libitum throughout the experiment. Animals were weighed before beginning the exposure and once every week during the course of the experiment. Mice were housed in pairs. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council for Animal Care and approved by Health Canada’s Animal Care Committee.
index 8
data The particle suspensions were dispersed as described above under preparation of TiO2NP stocks section. The 486 µg/40µL stock suspensions of the TiO2NPs were diluted to obtain 18, 54, and 162 µg per 40 µL and dispersed by sonication for an additional minute. The doses 18, 54, 162 and 486 μg/mouse are equivalent to 1.5, 5, 15, and 45 working days at the Danish occupational exposure level for TiO2 (6.0mg Ti/m3~9.75mg TiO2/m3), respectively. Although physiologically high, the dose 486 µg/mouse was included in the study to determine whether TiO2NPs induce pathological changes at the higher doses. The suspensions were used immediately after the preparation. MilliQ water devoid of particles was used to expose control animals.
index 9
data Each treatment group consisted of 10 animals. Mice in the experimental groups received a single intratracheal instillation of 18 µg (very low), 54 µg (low dose), 162 µg (medium dose) or 486 µg (high dose) of TiO2NPs in a 40-µL suspension prepared as described above, followed by 150 μl air with a 250 µL SGE glass syringe (250F-LT-GT, MicroLab, Aarhus, Denmark). Intratracheal instillation was performed under anaesthesia with 5% isoflurane (Isoflo, Esteve Farma, Carnaxide, Portugal) in 100% oxygen. Control mice received 40 µL of vehicle (MilliQ water) only. Following instillation, mice were kept under observation until they recovered from anaesthesia. Mice were killed on Days 1, 28 and 90 post-exposure. Blood, BALF and lung tissue were collected. One set of five experimental and five control mice were lavaged and the left lobe of lung from these mice were cut into two pieces, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in cryogenic vials at −80°C until analysis. The other set of five experimental and five control mice were not lavaged. Whole lungs from these mice were fixed in formalin (three mice/group) or glutaraldehyde (two mice/group) for histopathology and TEM analysis, respectively. Various end points investigated at the different post-exposure time points are listed in Figure 1.
index 10
data The BALF cytospins were prepared as described by Poulsen et al. (27) previously. The cytospins were fixed with two sprays of Sheldon Cell Fix and air-dried and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H & E). A total of 500 cells were counted per cytospin to identify mononuclear cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes using an optical microscope (Olympus BH2, Olympus Optical Company Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). A non-parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc Tukey-type test (28) was conducted to examine the effect of doses compared with the matched control using Origin version 8 (Northampton, MA, USA). Two-way ANOVA was conducted that examined the effect of particle and dose for the three post-exposure time points. Data were analysed using the R statistical computing environment (29). The model assumptions for normality and the constant variance assumption were tested using the Anderson–Darling statistic for normality (30) and the Leven’s test for homogeneity of variance (31). However, these assumptions were not satisfied. As a result, the analysis was conducted on the ranks. As the interaction term was significant (P < 0.0001), the post hoc analysis was conducted on the pairwise comparisons. The Holm–Sidak procedure (32) was used to adjust the P values for multiple testing. The estimate and standard error was reported using the untransformed data.
index 11
data Cell-free BALF supernatants were assessed for evidence of lung injury at 1- and 90-day post-exposure time points.
index 12
data Commercially available β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity colorimetric assay kit (Biovision, CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In this assay, 125 µL standard synthetic p-nitrophenol derivative (pNP) or BALF were incubated for 30min at 37°C in the presence of NAG substrate, when the reaction was terminated by adding a stop solution. The release of pNP was determined by measuring the absorbance at 400nm.
index 13
data Commercially available alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity fluorometric assay kit (Biovision, CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 120 µL BALF or standard ALP enzymes were incubated with 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate disodium salt (MUP) for 30min at room temperature, when the reaction was terminated by adding a stop solution. The fluorescence was measured at Ex/Em = 360nm/440nm using a fluorescence microtitre plate reader.
index 14
data TEM analysis of lung tissues was conducted through the services available at the Electron Microscopy Core Laboratory, Cell Imaging and Histology Core Facility, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Canada. In brief, lung tissues from control and TiO2NP exposed (two mice/group) mice collected on Days 1, 28 or 90 post-exposure time points were perfused and fixed with 2.5 % glutaraldehyde (electron microscopy sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and 2% paraformaldehyde solution (electron microscopy sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). The fixed lung tissue samples were cut into small pieces, rinsed with 0.15M phosphate buffer and 0.15M sodium cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 2 % osmium tetroxide (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) and 0.05M potassium ferricyanide (Sigma–Aldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, ON, Canada) in 0.12M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2h. The osmofication was followed by three rinses with Milli-Q and en bloc staining with 1% uranyl acetate (Leica Microsystems, Ultrastain-1, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) in Milli-Q water overnight at 4°C. The samples were gradually dehydrated in ethanol on the following day and embedded in Epon according to the standard procedures (TAAB Laboratories Equipment, TAAB 812 resin kit, West Berkshire, UK). Embedded samples were ultrathin-sectioned on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). The resulting sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before they were visualised using TEM.
index 15
data Total RNA was isolated from random sections of the left lung lobe (n = 5 per experimental group) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified using RNeasy Plus Mini kits (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), and RNA quality and integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples showed RNA integrity numbers above seven.
index 16
data Total RNA (250ng) samples from individual mice (n = 5 per experimental and control group) and from Universal Mouse Reference total RNA (UMRR; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) were used to synthesise double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), which was then used to synthesise Cyanine-labelled cRNAs using Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cRNAs from experimental (control and TiO2NPs-exposed) groups were labelled with cyanine 5-CTP and reference cRNAs were labelled with cyanine 3-CTP using a T7 RNA polymerase in vitro transcription kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) and purified using RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). An equimolar amount of reference cRNA was mixed with each experimental cRNA sample and was hybridised to Agilent mouse 4×44k oligonucleotide microarrays (Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) for 17h in a hybridisation chamber at 65°C with a rotation speed of 10rpm. At the end of hybridization, arrays were scanned on an Agilent G2505B scanner according to manufacturer’s protocols (Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada). Gene expression data from the scanned images were extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5.3.1.
index 17
data A reference randomised block design (33) was used to analyse microarray data, normalised using LOcally WEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) regression modelling method and statistical significance of the differentially expressed genes was determined using MicroArray ANalysis Of VAriance (MAANOVA) in R statistical software (http://www.r-project.org). The Fs statistic (34) was used to test the treatment effects compared with the matched controls exposed to vehicle only and P values were estimated by the permutation method using residual shuffling. In order to minimise any false positives, the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction (35) was applied. The fold changes of gene expression were calculated considering the least square means. Genes showing expression changes of at least 1.5-fold in either direction compared with their matched controls and showing FDR P ≤ 0.05 were considered as significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and were used in all downstream analyses. All microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI gene expression omnibus database and can be accessed via the accession number GSE81570.
index 18
data Functional gene ontology (GO) analysis of the DEGs was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7. Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected GO processes, with a Fisher’s exact P ≤ 0.05 considered to be significantly enriched (over-represented). Specific biological pathways associated with the DEGs were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA). Pathways with a Fisher’s exact P value of ≤0.05 were considered for the interpretation of results.
index 19
data All DEGs from the highest dose of 486 µg/mouse groups were mined against the genomic data repositories in NextBio (http://ehsrb.nextbio.com) to identify curated studies of diseases with similar gene profiles, gene ranking and consistency in fold change directionality. Pairwise gene signature correlations and rank-based enrichment statistics were employed to calculate the NextBio scores for each disease. The disease (associated with TiO2NPs exposure) that ranked the highest was given a score of 100 and the rest were normalised accordingly. The meta-analysis function in NextBio was used to compare the DEGs associated with most enriched GOs from TiO2NP-exposed lung to those reflective of lung fibrosis from the curated datasets available in NextBio.
index 20
data For histopathology examinations, whole lungs from control and TiO2NP-exposed mice (n = 3) were perfused and fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated with graded alcohol and paraffin embedded prior to staining with H & E. Three mice per dose group per particle type for a total of 90 slides at each post-exposure time point were assessed. Lung sections from the 162 and 486 µg/mouse dose groups were also stained with Masson trichrome stain to assess collagen deposition. The service was carried out in the PALM Histology Core Facility, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
index 21
data Since the 18 µg/animal dose showed non-significant changes in the BALF inflammatory cell profile as measured by the BALF differential cell counts and since it did not induce any observable cellular toxicity as measured by the NAG or ALP assays, this dose group was not included in the microarray experiments and is not discussed in the Results section below.
index 22
data The primary particle size and morphology of aTiO28, aTiO220, aTiO2300, raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) were determined by TEM analysis. The average diameter of the majority of each particle type obtained from TEM analysis showed values close to those reported by the manufacturer, except for aTiO2300 (Table 1). Some differences in sizes and particle shapes were observed. Whereas aTiO28, raTiO220 and aTiO2300 were spherical in shape, the other TiO2NPs appeared elongated. The diameter of the cross sections ranged from 18nm to 52nm for the raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HY). The diameters of the elongated or rod shaped aTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP) were ~30nm and ~35–70nm, respectively, in the longest cross sections. Diameters of aTiO2300 were much smaller (100–120nm) than reported by the manufacturer. The size of the aTiO2300 was confirmed using nanoparticle tracking analysis (data not shown) by NanoSight LM20 (NanoSight, Amesbury, UK). All TiO2NPs were found agglomerated.
index 23
data DLS analysis of the particle suspension revealed that all TiO2NPs agglomerate in water. The number-weighted particle aggregate sizes are presented in Table 1. In suspended form, the rTiO220 (HP) had the smallest particle aggregate size of 39.3±7.3nm compared with 242.9±53.1nm or 242.9±56.4nm observed for aTiO220 and raTiO220, respectively. The number-weighted particle sizes for aTiO28, aTiO2300 and rTiO220 (HY) were 148.4±38.3, 130.1±49.8nm and 110.1±27.9, respectively.
index 24
data TEM analysis was used to detect TiO2NPs in the ultrastructures of the lung tissues collected on Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure. TEM images of vehicle only-exposed lung tissues did not reveal any particles on Day 1 (Supplementary Figure 1A-a and A-b) or on Day 28 (Supplementary Figure 1B-a and B-b) post-exposure. In general, all TiO2NPs were found mostly in an agglomerated state in lungs both at Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure at all the doses tested (Supplementary Figure 1 presents few representative TEM images of lungs exposed to individual TiO2NP type). The alveolar space (Supplementary Figure 1A-c, A-g and A-k), endothelium and epithelial membranes (Supplementary Figure 1A-d, A-h and A-l), macrophages (Supplementary Figure 1A-e and A-m), lamellar bodies (Supplementary Figure 1A-j), cytoplasm (Supplementary Figure 1A-i and A-n) and caveolin and near collagen fibres (Supplementary Figure 1A-f) were some of the structures of lungs where TiO2NPs were found on Day 1 post-exposure.
index 25
data TiO2NPs were mainly observed in alveolar space near the microvilli (Supplementary Figure 1B-c, B-f, B-k), within the microvilli (Supplementary Figure 1B-d, B-f and B-n) and inside the vesicles (Supplementary Figure 1B-e, B-l and B-m), in samples collected on Day 28 post-exposure. At this time point, particles were mostly found in a non-agglomerated state suggesting that over time, the larger agglomerates may be breaking down.
index 26
data BALF from five mice from each control and exposed groups was assessed for differential cell counts. Details of the total and differential cell counts are summarised in Figure 2 and in Supplementary Table 1. As such, no general trend in increase in total cell number was observed; however, a non-significant dose-dependent increase in the total number of cells in BALF was observed on Day 1 post-exposure for raTiO220 NPs (Figure 2A). On Day 28 post-exposure, only the rutile/anatase and rutile groups showed increased number of BALF cells at the high dose (Figure 2B).
index 27
data The mononuclear cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes accounted for 98–99.7%, 0.3–1.8% and ~1.0% of the total cell population of control BALF, respectively. According to the cellular profiles shown in Figure 2A, a dose-dependent decrease in the number of mononuclear cells (Figure 2A-b) and concomitant increase in the number of neutrophils (Figure 2A-c) was observed at Day 1 post-exposure, regardless of the type of TiO2NPs. The highest increase in neutrophils was observed in mouse lungs exposed to rTiO220 (HP) (Supplementary Table 1 and Figure 2A-c). The changes in the number of lymphocytes at any dose were not significant (Figure 2A-d).
index 28
data The changes in the number of mononuclear cells following exposure to rutile/anatase or rutile NPs were observed but not for the anatase NPs on Day 28 post-exposure (Figure 2B-b); a dramatic decrease in the number of BALF neutrophils was observed for all groups (Figure 2B-c). Moreover, a dose-dependent increase in the total number of lymphocytes was observed for all TiO2NP groups on Day 28 post-exposure; although only the changes at medium and high doses were significant (Figure 2B-d).
index 29
data Global lung gene expression profiles derived from a total of 240 microarrays were used to assemble the data. Two main comparisons were made: (i) aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300 were compared to understand size-related effects and (ii) raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) were compared to understand the influence of surface modification. Each individual data set was analysed separately to identify the specific changes in gene expression compared with the matched vehicle controls. A list of all DEGs (upregulated and downregulated genes) on Day 1 and Day 28 following exposure to six individual types of TiO2NPs are presented in Supplementary Table 2. Figure 3A summarises the number of upregulated and downregulated genes for all doses and post-exposure time points for each particle type.
index 30
data A total of 225, 105 and 85 unique DEGs (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 3a–c. The DEGs that were common to more than one dose were only counted once.) were found in the lungs of mice exposed to aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300, respectively, on Day 1 post-exposure time point. Specific to individual dose groups, aTiO28 did not have any DEGs at the low (54 µg) dose; whereas 8 (all upregulated) and 224 (185 genes upregulated and 39 downregulated) DEGs were found in the 162 and 486 µg dose groups, respectively. The most DEGs were mainly associated with the inflammatory and acute phase signalling pathways. The large fold changes were observed for members of the Serum amyloid A (Saa); Saa3 (38.0-fold), Saa2 (3.4-fold) and Saa1 (8.9-fold). The others included tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (Timp1, 10.1-fold), chemokine (C–C motif) ligand (Ccl) 2 (Ccl2, 6.3-fold), Ccl7 (6.8 fold), lipocalin 2 (Lcn2, 5.1-fold), chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand (Cxcl) 1 (Cxcl1, 4.0-fold), Cxcl10 (3.8-fold) and Cxcl5 (3.6-fold). Fewer DEGs were observed for the aTiO220 type at all doses and post-exposure time points; a total of 4, 4 and 72 upregulated and 0, 0 and 30 downregulated DEGs in the 54, 162 and 486 µg dose groups were observed, respectively, at Day 1 post-exposure. Saa3 (79.6-fold), Saa1 (10.1-fold), Timp1 (11.7-fold), Ccl2 (4.7-fold) and Lcn2 (9.0-fold) were significantly differentially expressed for aTiO220. The lungs of mice exposed to aTiO2300 showed a total of 85 unique genes differentially expressed. Among these 4, 6 and 69 DEGs were upregulated and 2, 0 and 12 were downregulated in 54, 162 and 486 µg dose groups, respectively. A large number of inflammation-associated genes including, Saa3 (71.2-fold), Saa2 (4.3-fold), Saa1 (8.4-fold), Timp1 (6.6-fold), Ccl2 (2.8-fold), Ccl7 (2.8-fold), Ccl17 (2.6-fold), Lcn2 (8.7-fold), Cxcl1 (2.1-fold), Cxcl10 (1.9-fold) and Cxcl5 (3.4-fold) were significantly expressed in mouse lungs exposed to aTiO2300 at the highest dose.
index 31
data At Day 28, the response was largely reversed for all three particle types. A total of 8, 5 and 25 DEGs were (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 3d–f) found in the lungs of mice exposed to aTiO28,
aTiO220 and aTiO2300, respectively, at Day 28 post-exposure. The aTiO28 group showed 2 (upregulated) and 8 (3 upregulated and 5 downregulated) DEGs in the 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups, respectively. The aTiO220 NPs induced differential expression of 5 (3 upregulated and 2 downregulated) and 3 (2 upregulated and 1 downregulated) genes in each of the 54 and 486 µg dose groups, respectively, and none in the 162 µg dose group. Nr1d1(2-fold), Spon2 (−2.1-fold) and Nr1d1(1.9-fold) genes associated with inflammation were altered following exposure to aTiO28 and aTiO220, respectively. In the mice treated with aTiO2300, 1, 4 and 12 DEGs were upregulated and 4, 7 and 11 genes were downregulated in the 54 µg, 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups, respectively. Myl9 (1.6-fold) associated with muscle contractile activity and Hspa1a (-1.8-fold) and KFL4/KFL9 (−1.8-fold) genes associated with carcinoma were significantly perturbed following aTiO2300 exposure; none of the DEGs in the aTiO2300-exposed lungs was associated with inflammation.
index 32
data In contrast to the anatase type TiO2NPs described above, the transcriptomic responses to rutile type raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) were robust. A total of 719, 104 and 354 genes were (Supplementary Table 3g–i) differentially expressed in the lungs of mice exposed to raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP), respectively, on Day 1 post-exposure. The mixed unmodified raTiO220-induced 33 DEGS (31 upregulated and 2 downregulated) in the 54 µg, 108 DEGs (84 upregulated and 24 downregulated) in the 162 µg and 714 DEGs (401 upregulated and 313 downregulated) in the 486 µg dose groups (Supplementary Table 3g–i). The rTiO220 (HY) modified with aluminum oxide and dimethicone induced fewer DEGs compared with raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP) at all the doses tested; 4, 25 and 69 genes were upregulated and 4, 15 and 35 genes were downregulated for the 54 µg, 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups (Supplementary Table 3g–i). In comparison, the rTiO220 (HP) modified with aluminum oxide and glycerol induced significantly higher number of DEGs at all three doses and post-exposure time points; a total of 70, 134 and 177 genes were upregulated and 11, 17 and 102 DEGs were downregulated on Day 1 post-exposure in the 54 µg, 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups, respectively.

data At the highest dose, the genes associated with inflammation including, Saa3 (64.5, 41.6, 87.6-fold), Saa2 (5.6, 5.1, 5.4-fold), Saa1 (13.0, 5.2, 11-fold), Ccl7 (4, 4, 6.2 fold), Ccl17 (3.5, 3.5, 3-fold), Lcn2 (9.3, 5.9, 8.5-fold) and Cxcl1 (2.2, 3.8, 3.2-fold) showed the highest fold changes following exposure to raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) or rTiO220 (HP), respectively. The Ccl2 (6.3-fold) showed significant fold change following exposure to rTiO220 (HP) only. In addition, the expression of interleukin 1 receptor, type II (Il1r2, 3.3, 2.7-fold), (Il1B, 1.9, 2.2-fold), cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (Cyp7b1, 3.3, 3.4-fold) and placenta growth factor (Pgf, 2.2, 2.0-fold) responsible for fibrosis were also upregulated following exposure to raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP), respectively, and Timp1 (19.8, 5.5, 12.7-fold) and Cd14 antigen, (Cd14—1.9, 1.8, 2.3-fold) were differentially expressed in all three rutile groups, raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP) and rTiO220 (HY). Serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade E, member 1, (Serpine1, 2.6- fold) was upregulated only in the raTiO220 group.
index 34
data Fewer genes were altered at Day 28 post-exposure to raTiO220 (Supplementary Table 3j); none in the 54 µg dose group, and 1 upregulated and 1 DEGs downregulated in the 162 µg group. In the 486 µg group, 9 were upregulated and 7 DEGs were downregulated. Ly6f (2.8-fold), Trem2 (2.2-fold), Nr1d2 (1.9-fold) and Spon2 (−2.3-fold) were among the genes differentially expressed at the highest dose that were associated with inflammation. Several genes were persistently altered at Day 28 following exposure to rTiO220 (HY) (Supplementary Table 3k); 3 (1 upregulated, 2 downregulated), 13 (9 upregulated, 4 downregulated) and 34 (25 upregulated, 9 downregulated) genes showed differential expression in the 54, 162 and 486 µg groups, respectively. In response to rTiO220 (HP), 9 (2 upregulated and 7 downregulated), 21 (13 upregulated and 8 downregulated) and 148 (131 upregulated and 17 downregulated) DEGS were found in the 54, 162 and 486 µg dose groups, respectively (Supplementary Table 3l). Several genes associated with inflammation and acute phase signalling were persistently altered at Day 28 following exposure to rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP). These included Saa3 (27.7 and 7.0-fold), Lcn2 (7.9 and 6.3-fold), Cxcl5 (5.4 and 5.7-fold), Ccl7 (4.0 and 5.0-fold), Cxcl1 (3.6 and 2.6-fold), Clec5a (2.5 and 2.5-fold) and Cd14 (2.1 and 1.8-fold), respectively, at the high dose. In addition, pro-fibrotic genes including Cd14 (2.1-fold), Timp1 (2.5-fold) and Cyp7b1 (2.2-fold) following rTiO220 (HY) and Ccl2 (4.1-fold), Csf2 (2.1-fold), Cd14 (1.8-fold), Adora1 (1.7-fold) and Il1rn (1.5-fold) following rTiO220 (HP) showed largest changes at the high dose.
index 35
data In addition to a separate assessment of the individual data sets, a hierarchical clustering of genes differentially expressed in at least one experimental condition was conducted to determine particle, dose, or time-dependent expression patterns (Figure 3B). The analysis revealed that the expression patterns were similar for individual mice within the same treatment groups. Two main clusters were observed: Cluster-1 consisted of all doses of the five TiO2NPs for Day 28 post-exposure time point excluding raTiO220, along with Day 1 post-exposure samples of rTiO220 (HY) from the low-dose group. The Cluster-2 included Day 1 samples of all six TiO2NP types along with Day 28 post-exposure samples of raTiO220 from all dose groups and Day 28 post-exposure samples of rTiO220 (HY) from the high-dose group. The results suggested that the observed responses at the gene expression level were mainly post-exposure time-dependent and particle-specific differences were not observed (Figure 3B).
index 36
data The DEGs were analysed to identify specific biological functions, processes or pathways perturbed following exposure. In agreement with the total number of DEGs, a large number of perturbed biological processes were observed in the 162 and 486 µg dose groups. The list of all biological processes affected at Day 1 post-exposure for all doses are summarised in Supplementary Table 4. Immune/inflammation responses were the top processes affected following exposure to all anatase TiO2NPs, with enrichment of GO annotations such as inflammatory response (GO:0006954), response to wounding (GO:0009611), defense response (GO:0006952), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), taxis (GO:0042330) and behaviour (GO:0007610). In addition, genes in the high-dose group of the aTiO2300 also perturbed steroid metabolic process (GO: 0008202). The largest significant changes were observed in mice exposed to aTiO28. No biological processes were significantly altered in aTiO220-exposed lungs. Two biological processes—transcription (GO:0006350) and rhythmic process (GO:0048511)—were altered in aTiO2300 group at Day 28 post-exposure. There were no significantly altered biological processes for the other two anatase types.
index 37
data The microarray data were further analysed through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to understand the implications of the altered genes in lung diseases and disorders. The list of all KEGG pathways affected at Day 1 post-exposure is provided in Supplementary Table 4; the cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction (mmu04060), chemokine signalling pathway (mmu04062) and NOD-like receptor signalling (mmu04621) pathways implicated in the inflammation process were among the top pathways affected. In addition, the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (mmu00900) and p53 signalling pathway (mmu04115) were altered in response to aTiO28 and aTiO220, and extracellular matrix (ECM)–receptor interaction (mmu04512) and focal adhesion (mmu04510) were perturbed in response to aTiO28. This response was not seen in Day 28 post-exposure samples. A heat map of enriched (−log P value ≥ 1.3) canonical pathways (IPA) regulated by the DEGs at Day 1 and Day 28 are presented in Figure 4. IPA revealed unique association of DEGs in the high-dose group of aTiO220 with the p53 signalling pathway and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated signalling pathway, implying DNA damage response. The p53 signalling pathway was among the significantly perturbed KEGG pathways that was associated with DEGs of aTiO220 and aTiO28. The DEGs in the high-dose group of aTiO28 and aTiO2300 showed significant association with the pathways of hepatic fibrosis and interleukin 17 signalling in fibroblasts, suggesting a potential for these particles to induce lung fibrosis.
index 38
data Only a few altered canonical pathways that included acute phase signalling, glucocorticoid receptor signalling and FXR/VDR/LXR/RXR activation were significantly perturbed on Day 28 for all three anatase TiO2NPs.
index 39
data The results showed that the altered DEGs in this group are involved in inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300 induced 24, 12 and 24 DEGs associated with inflammation; 13, 4 and 8 DEGs associated with fibrosis and 2, 7 and 5 DEGs associated with oxidative stress in the 486 µg dose group (Supplementary Figure 3).These genes were no longer significantly expressed on Day 28 post-exposure.
index 40
data The biological processes perturbed on Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure for all doses are summarised in Supplementary Table 5. Immune/inflammation responses were the top biological processes affected on Day 1 post-exposure, with enrichment of GO annotations, such as inflammatory response (GO:0006954), response to wounding (GO:0009611), defense response (GO:0006952), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), taxis (GO:0042330) and behaviour (GO:0007610) (Supplementary Table 5-a). DEGs in the high-dose group of the rTiO220 and rTiO220 (HY) were also associated with steroid metabolic process (GO:0008202). Processes corresponding to cell adhesion were perturbed in the high-dose raTiO220 group.
index 41
data At Day 28, significant alterations in the immune/inflammation responses (Supplementary Table 5-b), which were associated with inflammatory response (GO:0006954), response to wounding (GO:0009611), defense response (GO:0006952), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), taxis (GO:0042330) and behaviour (GO:0007610) were seen only in rTiO220 (HP) group at the highest dose. raTiO220 perturbed the alteration of regulation of transcription (GO:0045449), RNA metabolism (GO:0051252), circadian rhythm (GO:0007623) and rhythmic processes (GO:0048511). No significant changes in the biological processes were observed in rTiO220 (HY) group at any dose at this late time point.
index 42
data The list of all KEGG pathways affected at Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure is provided in Supplementary Table 5; the cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction (mmu04060), chemokine signalling pathway (mmu04062) and NOD-like receptor signalling (mmu04621) pathways implicated in the inflammation process were among the top pathways affected. In addition, the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (mmu00900), ECM-receptor interaction (mmu04512), focal adhesion (mmu04510) and p53 signalling pathway (mmu04115) were altered in lungs in response to raTiO220.
index 43
data At Day 28 post-exposure, only rTiO220 (HP) and rTiO220 (HY) showed perturbations in the inflammatory (cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction (mmu04060) and chemokine signalling (mmu04062)) pathways. In addition, rTiO220 (HP) showed perturbations in toll-like receptor signalling pathway (mmu04620) and NOD-like receptor signalling (mmu04621) and lysosome (mmu04142) pathways.
index 44
data Heat map of enriched (−log P ≥ 1.3) canonical pathways regulated by the DEGs at Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure are presented in Figure 5. The top five canonical pathways associated with DEGs on Day 1 include acute phase response signalling, agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia in pathogenesis and communication between innate and adaptive immune cells. In addition to inflammatory pathways, hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation and hepatic cholestasis were perturbed even in the low-dose groups of the rutile raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP) and in the medium- and high-dose groups of the rTiO220 (HY) at Day 1 post-exposure (Figure 4). Altered inflammatory pathways such as acute phase response signalling, agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis were also observed at Day 28 post-exposure for all rutile NPs. At this this time point, the fibrosis pathway was altered only in the high-dose group of the rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP).
index 45
data The results also showed that raTiO220 induced highest number of DEGs associated with fibrotic (25 DEGs at the high dose) and oxidative stress (14 DEGs at the high dose) response categories on Day 1 (Supplementary Figure 5); however, these genes were no longer significantly expressed on Day 28 post-exposure. The rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) induced 6 and 11 DEGs associated with fibrosis on Day 1, respectively. Six of those induced by rTiO220 (HY) were also observed on Day 28. Only three DEGs were induced by rTiO220 (HP) on Day 28, which were mainly associated with inflammation.
index 46
data Diseases and functions predicted from IPA showed that the diseases and functions related to inflammation were activated in lungs treated with the anatase TiO2NPs on Day 1 post-exposure (Supplementary Figure 6). In addition to diseases and functions related to inflammation, diseases and functions related to DNA damage were also activated in lungs treated with aTiO220. These diseases and functions were no longer activated on Day 28 post-exposure. In the rutile/anatase and rutile-exposed groups, the diseases and functions related to inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress were activated in the 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups (Supplementary Figure 6) on Day 1 post-exposure. These diseases and functions related to inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress were only activated in the 486 µg dose groups on Day 28 post-exposure.
index 47
data DEGs from the 162 and 486 µg dose groups of all six particle types were analysed using the NextBio Human Atlas (Supplementary Table 6) to identify their potential association with known human diseases. The analysis showed that respiratory disorders, viral infectious diseases, bacterial infectious disease, parasitic disease, and nutritional and metabolic disease are among the top disease categories associated with the DEGs. The sub-categories in the respiratory disorders category included severe acute respiratory syndrome, infectious disease of lung, lower respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, injury of lung, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and fibrosis of lung.
index 48
data A recently published INHAND system was used to classify lung morphology and lung lesions.(36) The H & E-stained slides were blinded for the type of TiO2NPs. The detailed lung lesion inventory is provided in Supplementary Table 7. For each lesion category, a numeric score from 0 to 5 was assigned based on a subjective assessment of the lesion severity, which corresponded to lesion not present, minimal, mild, moderate, marked and severe, respectively.
index 49
data The results showed that lung sections from vehicle-treated control mice on Day 1 post-exposure are well ventilated with a few macrophages distributed diffusely in the alveolar spaces (Figure 6A–a). Infiltration of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils was observed in the treated groups in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6Ab–m). The alveolar macrophages were heavily laden with NPs. Alveolar inflammation or alveolitis was assessed by the presence of granulomatous and pyogranulomatous like structures dominated by large numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, respectively. Mild macrophage–neutrophilic alveolitis was also observed in the 162 µg dose group (Figure 6A-b–g). The degree of alveolitis in centriacinar area regions was more prominent in the 486 µg dose group for all particle types (Figure 6A-h–m).
index 50
data The lung sections remained well ventilated on Day 28 post-exposure (Figure 6B-a). A dose-dependent increase in the alveolar macrophages was observed for some particle types mainly at 162 (Figure 6B-b–g) or 486 µg doses (Figure 6B-n–s); however, this change was less significant compared with the Day 1 post-exposure groups (Supplementary Table 7-b). Peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltrations of lymphocytes were observed in the 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups, except in mice exposed to aTiO2300 (Supplementary Table 7-b). Focal to multifocal granulomatous and pyogranulomatous inflammation were more pronounced in rTiO220 (HY)- and rTiO220 (HP)-exposed lungs in the 162 µg (Figure 6B-f–g) and 486 µg dose groups (Figure 6B-r–s). Lung sections were stained with Masson’s trichrome staining to assess collagen deposition on Day 28 post-exposure in the medium- and high-dose groups. Masson’s trichrome staining showed that collagen depositions were minimal in lung sections treated with TiO2NPs in the 162 µg dose groups (Figure 6B-h–m). Collagen depositions were higher in rTiO220 (HY)- and rTiO220 (HP)-exposed lungs in the 486 µg dose groups (Figure 6B-t–y) compared with other lung sections treated with other TiO2NP types.
index 51
data aTiO28, raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) showed larger transcriptomic responses compared with other particle types, suggesting some TiO2NPs may be more harmful than others. Thus, a series of experiments were conducted at 90-day post-exposure to determine whether differential transcriptomics responses among the TiO2NPs eventually translates into disease manifestation for some TiO2NPs. TEM analysis of lung sections (Figure 7) showed that an appreciable fraction of TiO2NPs deposited via single intratracheal instillation were retained in lung tissues up to 90 days post-exposure regardless of the specific size or surface modifications, in the 162 and 486 µg dose groups (Figure 7-a–l). The TiO2NPs were mostly found dispersed in the cytoplasm and some were localized to phagocytic vacuoles (Figure 7-e–g). In lung sections from the aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HP)-exposed groups, particles were found inside the nuclei (Figure 7-d, 7–l).
index 52
data BALF cellularity analysis revealed small increases in total cell number (Supplementary Figure 7A-a and B-a), macrophages (Supplementary Figure 7A-b and B-b) and lymphocytes (Supplementary Figure 7A-c and B-c) at 90-day post-exposure, indicating persistent but subtle inflammation. No general trends specific to particle types were observed.
index 53
data To further understand the nature of the response observed at Day 90 post-exposure, cytotoxicity was assessed using β-NAG activity and ALP activity (37) in cell-free BALF supernatants collected on Day 1 and Day 90 post-exposure. Increased β-NAG activity is indicative of macrophage lysosomal activation (38). Increased ALP activity is used as a marker of (39) pathological pulmonary conditions, in which epithelial damage is a central feature of the pathogenesis, such as acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, viral pneumonia and particulate matter-induced lung toxicity (40). The results showed that the β-NAG (Supplementary Figure 8A-a and A-b) activity increased significantly on Day 1 following exposure to aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HY) at the medium and high doses and in lungs exposed to rTiO220 (HP) at the high-dose group in comparison with their matched controls. The ALP activity (Supplementary Figure 8B-a and B-b) was significantly higher on Day 1 in lungs of mice exposed to aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HP) at the medium and high doses and in lungs exposed to aTiO28and rTiO220 at the high-dose group compared with their matched controls. The increased β-NAG or ALP activities on Day 1 (Supplementary Figure 8B-a and B-b) were reduced significantly on Day 90.
index 54
data In alignment with the observations above, the lung sections from the treated animals showed an increased infiltration of alveolar macrophages throughout but particularly in centriacinar area alveolar spaces at 90 Day post-exposure (Figure 8). Perivascular and peribronchiolar infiltrations of inflammatory cells were often observed irrespective of the type of TiO2NPs (Figure 8). Alveolar or septal fibroblast proliferation and granulomatous alveolar inflammation dominated by macrophages and lymphocytes were observed occasionally in treated lungs. Control mice showed only a subtle and diffuse infiltration of alveolar macrophages (Figure 8A-a–c and B-a–c). Masson’s trichrome staining for collagen revealed the presence of mild fibrosis in lungs exposed to aTiO28 (Figure 8A-j and A-p), rTiO220 (HY) (Figure 8B-k and B-q) and rTiO220 (HP) (Figure 8B-l and B-r). A mild and focal type 2 pneumocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, indicative of repair of alveolar epithelium was found only in lungs exposed to medium dose of rTiO220 (HP) (data not shown).
index 55
data As stated earlier in the introduction above, it is a well-known fact that the primary particle size and the resulting surface area influence the toxicity induced by several classes of NMs including TiO2NPs. For TiO2NP variants, lung exposures leading to acute pulmonary inflammation is suggested to be predominantly dependent on size but also on several other properties such as the surface modifications. However, it is not known whether the underlying mechanisms of pulmonary inflammation are the same for all and it is also not clear whether subtle differences in the severity of acute pulmonary inflammation observed for some TiO2NP variants (22) translate into a disease phenotype at a later post-exposure time point. Thus, in the present study, we conducted a detailed assessment of lung responses to six different types of TiO2NPs with varying sizes, modifications and crystalline structures. Although the TiO2NP types investigated in the study were not synthesised in a controlled manner to vary in only one property at a time, from the results of the comprehensive assessment conducted, it can be concluded that the underlying mechanisms of acute pulmonary inflammation induced by TiO2NPs are the same regardless of their properties, which is in alignment with the previous study results published by this research group (22). Also in alignment were the results showing that while size may be the primary determinant of the toxic potential of TiO2NPs, surface modifications influence the severity of the response with hydrophilic surface being more inflammogenic compared with the other types. Halappanavar et al. (22) compared the lung transcriptomic responses in mice exposed to rutile TiO2NPs of 10nm, 38nm and 10nm TiO2NPs with hydrophilic surface and showed that at the transcriptional level, 10nm particles were more responsive with highest number of DEGs. However, surface amination of 10nm TiO2NPs resulting in hydrophilic surface increased the severity of the response (larger fold changes in inflammation-associated genes). The extensive transcriptomic profiling and histopathological analysis conducted in the present study confirm these findings. In the present study, the number of DEGs at Day 1 post-exposure to anatase-type TiO2NPs was remarkably lower for the aTiO2300 with the surface area of 10 m2/g (85 genes) and was highest for the aTiO28 exhibiting 229–235 m2/g (225 genes). While the primary particle size may have been instrumental in the lung responses induced by the anatase type TiO2NPs, for the rutile types [raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP)], mixed properties including surface modifications and crystallinity appeared to have influenced the responses. New to the present study was the finding that anatase TiO2NPs were less responsive compared with the rutile/anatase and rutile TiO2NPs at the transcriptional level. Although a direct comparison of responses induced by the anatase and rutile types was not possible as they vary in their surface properties, the overall biological response of mice exposed to anatase type TiO2NPs was less compared with the rutile ones. Previous studies have shown that crystalline structure of TiO2NPs plays an important role in toxicity induced by these particles (16,18).
index 56
data Among the rutile types, all three of them were of 20nm in size and exhibited a surface area between 51 and 57 m2/g, which is relatively less compared with the surface area of anatase aTiO220 90 m2/g. It was observed that the number of DEGs induced by rTiO220 (HY) were similar to the number of DEGs induced by aTiO220; however, rTiO220 (HP) induced considerably higher number of genes at all doses and post-exposure time points compared with the other rutile and anatase TiO2NP types. These results suggest that the transcriptional responses to rutile type TiO2NPs are influenced by their surface modifications and that the hydrophilic surface positively impacts the lung responses. Although all rutile types are similar in size and surface area, mixed rutile/anatase type exhibited significantly larger transcriptomic response at the highest dose tested. The raTiO220 has been previously shown to exert higher toxicity compared with the other rutile or anatase only TiO2NPs (41–43). The higher activity of raTiO220 compared with that of either pure rutile type can be suggested to be due to the synergistic effects between rutile and anatase crystalline phases (44); however, this could not be confirmed since the present study did not include an unmodified rutile TiO2 type.
index 57
data The results of the gene expression analysis were in agreement in general with the BALF cellularity and inflammatory cell infiltration. However, the BALF results were not sensitive enough to identify the subtle differences between the responses induced by the different particle types, implying that gene expression profiling may be a sensitive tool to identify property-specific toxicity attributes of particles. Although the results confirm that particle size for the unmodified and hydrophilic surface for the modified are the important properties playing a role in the toxicity induced by TiO2NPs, more studies involving TiO2NPs of a range of sizes and surface properties are required to affirm this knowledge.
index 58
data The larger response of rTiO220 (HP) at the gene expression level was also reflected in the results of the histopathology showing persistent inflammation, alveolitis and granulomatous/pyogranulomatous inflammatory lesions reflective of mild fibrosis. Higher toxicity following exposure to hydrophilic rTiO220 has been shown in rats exposed via inhalation (5). Teubl et al. (45) showed that compared with rTiO220 (HY), the rTiO220 (HP) induces pronounced generation of reactive oxygen species by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential in human buccal epithelial TR146 cells (46). Surface-coated NMs are shown to exert higher toxicity compared with the pristine types; silica-coated rutile TiO2NPs elicit higher pulmonary neutrophilia, in in vivo and in vitro models (5). Rutile TiO2NPs coated with alumina or alumina/silica induce higher inflammation compared with the uncoated TiO2NPs in Sprague Dawley rats (47). In contrast to the above, a study by Warheit et al. showed that the uncoated raTiO220 are more harmful than the alumina or alumina/silica coated TiO2NPs in rats exposed by intratracheal instillation, suggesting that the crystalline structure may also be important (16,18). The latter results reflect what we have observed in this study with raTiO220 showing highest number of differentially expressed genes acutely after the exposure at the highest dose tested.
index 59
data Although it was not possible to elucidate the exact reasons why hydrophilic surface renders particles more toxic, we speculate that the nature of the surface coating of the core NPs and resulting surface charge may be playing a role in determining NP–cell interactions, such as altering the cellular membrane permeability and cellular localisation upon uptake. NMs that are strongly hydrophobic in nature may non-specifically interact with the cell membrane leading to their internalisation. Preferential cellular uptake of positively charged NMs could be occurring due to the strong electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged cellular membrane (48). Studies also have shown a differential cellular localisation of the hydrophilic TiO2NPs compared with the hydrophobic TiO2NPs (49). The poor interactions with the lipid bilayer may also prolong the life of hydrophilic NPs in blood, which will allow them to reach specific sites and cause toxicity.
index 60
data The different types of TiO2NPs tested in this study confirmed our previous findings (22) that initial lung responses to TiO2NPs leading to lung inflammation involves similar mechanisms, which includes activation of acute phase signalling and granulocyte and agranulocyte diapedesis pathways resulting in cytokine/chemokine storm and infiltration of neutrophils into lung fluid. However, the magnitude of the observed response was higher and persistent for rutile types and even more pronounced in rTiO220 (HP) group, suggesting that the extent of the response is property specific. Since rTiO220 (HP)-induced expression changes in few of the genes that have known association with lung fibrosis, we compared the gene expression profiles generated from the present study with the gene profiles of lungs of mice exposed to carbon nanotubes that are known to induce lung fibrosis in the same mouse model at similar doses (27,50). A direct comparison of the 69 fibrosis-associated genes described in Poulsen et al. and Snyder-Talkington et al. study (27,50), with DEGs from the present study revealed a low level of concordance with very few overlapping genes (Table 2), which included Timp1, Ccl17, Serpine1, Sod2, Plaur1, Ccl2, Il1rn, Il1b, Ctsk and C3. Considering the fact that TiO2NPs are generally viewed as inert, the subtle pro-fibrotic gene responses suggest that histopathological observations of fibrotic-like changes at the high doses (162 µg and 486 µg/animal) of TiO2NPs may still be reflecting the early phase responses to disease development and that a full manifestation of fibrosis may require recurring exposure to TiO2NPs at similar dose levels. Alveolar metaplasia has been reported in rat but not in mice following exposure to TiO2NPs in previous studies (51,52). Retention of TiO2NPs in human lung has been reported following cumulative exposures in TiO2NP production plants (53,54). In some of these human cases, exposure to rutile TiO2NPs resulted in mild subpleural fibrosis (6,55–58). However, the specific properties of the TiO2NPs that the humans were exposed to are not identified. The results of the present study suggest that the hydrophilic surface may render TiO2NPs with pro-fibrotic potential in the long term when exposed to sufficiently high doses.
index 61
data Apart from the predominant inflammogenic gene expression changes, several genes associated with the p53 signalling pathway was found to be specifically altered following exposure to aTiO28 and aTiO220 NPs. TEM analysis also found particles in the nucleus following exposure to aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HP). These results suggest that some of them may have a potential to induce DNA damage. There are not many in vivo studies that have investigated the DNA damage potential of TiO2NPs. It was shown that a 21-nm anatase/rutile (59) and a 33-nm aTiO2NPs (60) induce DNA damage and genetic instability in blood cells of mice exposed orally over a short period of time. Intragastric administration of 75nm aTiO2NPs to male Sprague Dawley rats for 30 days (4) was shown to induce genotoxic effects in the bone marrow. However, positive genotoxic effects have not been observed in rodent lungs exposed to TiO2NPs via inhalation (61,62). Although many studies have investigated the genotoxic effects of TiO2NPs using in vitro models, the results are not consistent. For example, AMES assays showed no increases in the mutagenic potential of aTiO2NPs in vitro models. However, DNA damage analysis using comet assays showed that uncoated 20–50nm aTiO2NPs tested at a concentration of 100 µg/mL induced DNA breaks in BEAS2B cells, bottlenose dolphin leucocytes, human gastric adenocarcinoma cells, human epidermal cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (6,55–57). One other study showed positive DNA damage potential of 33nm aTiO2NPs in bone marrow and liver of CBAB6F1 mice exposed via gavage (60). However, at present, the properties of TiO2NPs or factors responsible for their DNA damaging potential are not understood.
index 62
data In conclusion, a comprehensive assessment of lung responses was conducted following exposure to six types of TiO2NPs exhibiting differences in size, crystalline structure and surface modifications across a range of doses and post-exposure time points. The results confirmed our previous findings that the underlying mechanisms leading to TiO2NP-induced lung inflammation acutely after exposure are the same regardless of their properties; however, the results suggested that the long-term pathological effects may be influenced by their specific properties such as crystallinity and surface modifications. Specifically, from the six types tested, a combination of properties such as rutile structure and hydrophilic surface can be deemed as pathologically more active compared to other types. Although TiO2NPs are generally regarded as inert, the results from the study suggest that unfavourable and chronic exposures to very high doses of certain TiO2NP types may result in tissue injury and initiate pro-fibrotic changes in lungs over a long period of time.

data Adenovirus (ADV) is one of the most common respiratory pathogens in childhood, and 13-17% of children hospitalized with a viral respiratory tract infection are diagnosed with an ADV infection [123]. Although most cases are self-limiting [34], ADV infection can lead to more severe complications and death. Specific serotypes of the ADV (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 21, and 55), a younger age (less than one year), and immunocompromised hosts have been reported as risk factors for severe ADV infection [567891011].
index 0
data Recently, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which are more sensitive and cost-effective than conventional antigen detection and culture methods, have been used for diagnosing respiratory viral infections [1213]. More cases of multiple respiratory viral infections have been diagnosed using these multiplex PCR tests than were reported before using conventional testing methods [121314]. Consequently, the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfections, especially coinfection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), has been evaluated since the 2000s [15]. In a recently published meta-analysis, respiratory viral coinfections were not reported to result in a significant increase in the clinical severity of respiratory infections compared with single viral infections [15]. However, their clinical effects vary depending on the coinfected viruses and the subjects enrolled in each study. Therefore, while respiratory viral coinfections reportedly manifest as more severe illnesses in some studies [1617], other investigators report a lack of association between viral coinfection and disease severity in ADV infected children [18]. Furthermore, even as ADV infection occurs steadily all year round in Korea, the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfection on childhood ADV infection has rarely been reported [19]. In addition, previous studies on ADV coinfections included only children younger than 1 or 3 years of age, or children with lower respiratory tract infections [182021]. This retrospective study was performed to investigate the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfections in Korean children with ADV infection.
index 1
data The medical records of children (below 20 years of age) admitted to the Department of Pediatrics at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, and diagnosed with ADV infection between January 2012 and December 2014, were retrospectively reviewed. Children with immunocompromised status (e.g., underlying hematological malignancy, bone marrow failure syndrome, or an autoimmune disorder requiring immunosuppressant therapy) were excluded. The enrolled children were divided into two groups based on the result of multiplex PCR test for common respiratory viruses. The ADV group included children infected by only ADV, whilst the coinfection group included children concurrently infected with two or more viruses including ADV.
index 2
data Demographic data included age and sex. Clinical data included birth history, the presence of siblings, the presence of underlying medical conditions, duration of fever and hospitalization, presenting symptoms on admission, final diagnosis on discharge, and severity of the ADV infection. Fever was defined when the tympanic membrane temperature was ≥38.0 ºC. Among presenting symptoms, respiratory symptoms included cough, rhinorrhea, sputum, nasal stuffiness and dyspnea, and gastrointestinal symptoms included vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Ophthalmologic symptoms included conjunctival injection, ocular pruritus, ocular pain and eye discharges. Neurologic symptoms included dizziness, headache and seizure-like motion, and dermatologic symptoms included various types of skin rashes. The ADV infection was considered severe in cases where oxygen therapy was given; the demand for oxygen increased in a child who had already received oxygen therapy; a child was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU); or a child died due to the ADV infection. On admission, blood tests were performed to assess total and differential white blood cell counts and platelet counts. In addition, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase levels were also assessed at admission. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were compared between the two children groups. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital (Approval No.: KC15RISI0767). Informed consent was waived for this study.
index 3
data On admission, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected from children complaining of respiratory symptoms or fever without a focus. Samples were sent, as soon as possible, to the Department of Laboratory Medicine where a multiplex PCR test for respiratory viruses was conducted. The commercially available AdvanSure™ RV real-time PCR kit (LG Life Sciences Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was used to detect ADV, influenza A and B viruses, RSV, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and human bocavirus. A positive PCR result for ADV confirmed an ADV infection. If the PCR result was positive for only ADV, the child was assigned to the ADV group, and if the PCR result was positive for two or more viruses including ADV, the child was assigned to the coinfection group.
index 4
data Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) included acute pharyngitis, pharyngoconjunctival fever, and acute otitis media, while lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) included acute bronchiolitis, acute bronchitis, and pneumonia.
index 5
data Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical variables between the two study groups were compared using a chi-square test, and continuous variables were compared using a Mann-Whitney test. Factors identified as significantly different between the ADV and coinfection groups in a univariate analysis were assessed for association with coinfection through a multivariate analysis using a binary logistic regression test. A P value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
index 6
data In total, 105 children were diagnosed with an ADV infection during the study period. The median age at enrollment was 29 months (range: 0-131 months), and 60 (57.1%) children were males. On admission, 104 (99.0%) children complained of fever, and the fever persisted for a median of 5 days (range: 0-13 days) [starting 3 days (range: 0-10 days) before admission and persisting until 2 days (range: 0-5 days) after admission]. Among the local symptoms presented on admission, respiratory symptoms (87 children, 82.9%) were the most frequent, followed by gastrointestinal (24 children, 22.9%) and ophthalmologic (18 children, 17.1%) symptoms. Among gastrointestinal symptoms, diarrhea (17 children, 70.8%) was most frequent, and vomiting (11 children, 45.8%) and abdominal pain (7 children, 29.2%) followed. Febrile seizures occurred in four (3.8%) children. Five children (4.8%) showed fever without localizing signs. URTI and LRTI were diagnosed in 56 (53.3%), and 32 (30.5%) children, respectively. Thirteen (12.4%) children had underlying medical conditions. Eleven (10.5%) children were born prematurely and eight (7.6%) of them also had a previous history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); one child had an underlying congenital hypotonia and had experienced recurrent pneumonia since birth; and one child received corrective surgery for esophageal atresia and experienced recurrent respiratory tract infections since the surgery.
index 7
data Five (4.8%) of the children enrolled in the present study received oxygen therapy, one (1.4%) child in the ADV group and four (12.5%) children in the coinfection group. The child in the ADV group was diagnosed during hospitalization for preterm birth and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). He was admitted to the neonatal ICU at birth, received ventilator care and surfactant replacement therapy, and was extubated on hospital day 6. However, fever and apnea developed on hospital day 25, and he received ventilator care again. ADV infection was diagnosed at this time, and he was extubated on hospital day 36. The four children in the coinfection group received oxygen therapy for less than 3 days: two children were born prematurely and had a history of BPD, one child had underlying congenital hypotonia, and the remaining one child was previously healthy.
index 8
data Thirty-two (30.5%) children were included in the coinfection group (Table 1). Of these, two viruses were simultaneously identified in 28 children (26.7%), and three viruses were simultaneously identified in 4 children (3.8%): ADV, rhinovirus and influenza B virus in one, ADV, rhinovirus and coronavirus in another, and ADV, rhinovirus and human bocavirus in the others. Rhinovirus (n = 15, 41.7%) and RSV (n = 7, 19.4%) were the most commonly coinfected viruses (Table 1).
index 9
data The proportion of children younger than 24 months was significantly higher in the coinfection group compared with the ADV group (P <0.001, Table 2). The children in the coinfection group had a significantly higher tendency for underlying medical conditions (P = 0.020), LRTI (P = 0.011), and need for oxygen therapy (P = 0.029), compared with children in the ADV group (Table 2). However, the duration of fever and hospitalization was not significantly different between the two groups (Table 2). Among laboratory test results, only absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) showed a significant difference between the two study groups (Table 3). The ESR and CRP levels were lower in the coinfection group than in the ADV group; however, this difference was not statistically significant (Table 3). In a multivariate analysis, only the younger age was significantly associated with respiratory viral coinfection (P <0.001, Table 4).
index 10
data As rhinovirus and RSV were the most common coinfected viruses, the ADV group was also compared with the ADV and rhinovirus coinfection group and the ADV and RSV coinfection group (Table 2). Children in the ADV and rhinovirus coinfection group tended to be younger and have more underlying medical conditions, and LRTIs compared with those in the ADV group; however, they did not receive more oxygen therapy. Similarly, children in the ADV and RSV coinfection group also tended to be younger, have more underlying medical conditions, and receive more oxygen therapy compared with those in the ADV group; however, the proportion of children with LRTIs was not significantly different between the two coinfection groups.
index 11
data In the present study, clinical and laboratory characteristics of ADV infection in children were investigated, and the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfection was determined. Respiratory viral coinfection caused more LRTI and a higher need for oxygen therapy than ADV single infection. However, coinfection did not lead to mortality, and the duration of fever and hospitalization was not significantly different between ADV and coinfection groups.
index 12
data ADV infection in the present study occurred at a median age of 29 months, and in agreement with previous reports, occurred more frequently in males than in females [39192223]. All children except one complained of fever on admission, with fever lasting for a median of 6 days, as is consistent with published reports [34192223]. Respiratory symptoms were most frequent, followed by gastrointestinal symptoms, and this was comparable with previous data [222324]. In the present study, ADV caused more URTIs than LRTIs, even as the current literature provides contradictory evidences, with some reporting a predominance of URTIs [42526], whilst others report a predominance of LRTIs [2324].
index 13
data Respiratory viral coinfections have been identified in 1.8% - 49.2% of respiratory tract infections in previous studies [1214202728]. The variability in the reported coinfection frequency could be due to the methods of viral detection, the number of detectable viruses, the characteristics of enrolled patients, the frequencies of underlying disorders, the seasons when the studies were performed, and the inclusion or exclusion of URTI [1428]. Most studies reported a higher frequency of respiratory viral coinfection in younger children than in older children and adults [12142728]. This presumably was caused by immature immune systems, the lack of protective immunity arising from prior exposures to viruses, and prolonged excretion of respiratory viruses in younger children compared with older children and adults [142128]. Although respiratory viral coinfection increased the rate and duration of hospitalization [141727], it eventually did not cause a poorer prognosis such as oxygen supplementation and ICU admission, compared with single viral infection [1727]. In a recent meta-analysis, the overall effect of respiratory viral coinfections on the disease severity and prognosis was not significant [15].
index 14
data In the present study, respiratory viral coinfection was identified in 30.5% of the enrolled children with ADV infection. This coinfection frequency was within the reported range (9.4 - 69.6%) [41922]. Rhinovirus was the most commonly coinfected virus in the present study with RSV being the second, and this was in concurrence with prior published reports [192228].
index 15
data Previous studies have reported significant association between younger age and coinfection in ADV infection, as is the case with other respiratory viral infections [18192122], and the present study also showed a significant increase in coinfection frequency in children younger than 24 months of age than that in older children. In addition, the increased LRTI cases we report in the coinfection group have been reported previously [1924]. In the present study, we observed a significant association between the presence of underlying medical conditions and coinfection, although this has not been a significant coinfection associated factor in some other previous studies [1822]. Eleven of 13 children with underlying medical conditions in the present study had a preterm birth history, and eight of them had a previous history of BPD. These medical conditions may affect the lower respiratory tract function during infancy and early childhood. Amongst younger age, LRTI, and underlying medical conditions, factors related to coinfection based on a univariate analysis, only the younger age was associated independently with coinfection following a logistic regression test.
index 16
data Respiratory viral coinfection in ADV infection may cause prolonged hospitalization with or without increase in disease severity, represented by oxygen supplementation and ICU admission [172021]. Some other investigators have, on the other hand, reported no significant effect of coinfection on the duration of hospitalization and disease severity [1822]. In the present study, coinfection caused more LRTIs compared with ADV single infection, and therefore, manifested as more clinically severe and progressive disease than ADV single infection. In addition, oxygen therapy was administered more frequently in the coinfection group, especially in children coinfected with ADV and RSV, than in the ADV group. However, the oxygen supplementation duration in the coinfection group was less than 3 days, and there was no ICU admission and mortality in this group. Furthermore, the duration of hospitalization and fever was not significantly different between the coinfection and ADV groups. This suggested that even as respiratory viral coinfection may contribute to increased disease severity in children with ADV infection, appropriate treatment for such a condition can prevent further disease progression and poor prognosis.
index 17
data The present study had several limitations, its retrospective nature being the first. We did not identify infecting ADV serotypes in our study, and the severity of ADV infection, as well as frequency of respiratory viral infection, varied according to the causative serotype [891011]. To evaluate the impact of specific ADV serotypes on clinical severity and frequency of coinfections, a multicenter study, involving several geographically-separated hospitals would need to be conducted for a sufficiently long period to capture multiple ADV outbreaks with different causative serotypes. Attending daycare centers may further increase the risk of exposure to a variety of respiratory viruses, and influence the frequency and severity of respiratory viral infections; however, this was not evaluated in the present study. We also could not determine the independent effect of each respiratory virus concurrently identified with ADV infection because of the small group size for each respiratory virus. Finally, the impact of coinfection on the long-term sequelae of ADV infection (e.g., bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans) could not be assessed [2930].
index 18
data In conclusion, respiratory viral coinfection in children with ADV infection occurred more frequently in children younger than 24 months of age compared with children aged 24 months or older, and respiratory viral coinfection increased the proportion of LRTI and oxygen therapy requirement. However, appropriate therapy prevented prolonged hospitalization and poor prognosis due to coinfection. Clinicians should thus be more mindful of younger children diagnosed with ADV infection, and be aware of possible coinfections and faster disease progression.

data In 1950, Professor Ling‐Chao Tsien () was ushered into a warehouse of the former Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) government Broadcasting Company in Nanjing, where he unpacked a cargo container full of unassembled parts of a transmission electron microscope (TEM). These TEM parts, manufactured by the British company Metropolitan‐Vickers, were purchased and hastily left behind by the fleeing Kuomintang government on its way to Taiwan. Professor Tsien was so excited about the serendipitous finding that he immediately decided to assemble the microscope despite lack of an installation handbook. In no more than 4 years, he and his co‐workers published the first electron microscopy (EM) research article in China,1 in which they described the fine structural defects of aluminum foil. This article marked the beginning of an era in China that relied on EM to examine the world at nanoscale. Application of EM soon became popular in China, especially due to its powerful utility in the characterization of inorganic materials for the steel and engineering industry.
index 0
data A number of pioneering scientists in materials science and physics have made notable contributions to the development of China's EM community. Beginning in the 1980s, a few leading electron microscopists in inorganic material research, including Ling‐Chao Tsien, Ke‐Hsin Kuo (), Fanghua Li (), Duan Feng (), and Renhui Wang (), realized the huge potential of high‐resolution EM in life sciences (Fig. 1). They invited foreign scientists in the field of cryo‐EM to visit China and give lectures and workshops to young students and encouraged the younger generation to devote themselves into cryo‐EM of biological application. Nowadays, more than two‐thirds of the established Chinese scientists in the field of cryo‐EM were directly trained or largely influenced by these pioneers (Fig. 1).
index 1
data At about the same period, a few young Chinese scientists from biology or biophysics launched their own expedition into cryo‐EM as the technology was developed in its premature phase. In the late 1970s, Jin‐Ju Chang () joined Jacques Dubochet's group at European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and became one of the very first few scientists studying frozen‐hydrated biological specimens using TEM.2, 3 Yun Li ()—working with Kevin Leonard at EMBL in 1980—studied mitochondria cytochrome c1 reductase complex in its single particle state using negative‐staining EM.4 Naiqian Cheng ()—working with James Deatherage at the University of Arizona—was among the first group of scientists studying the ordered insect muscle fibers using TEM.5 Da‐Neng Wang () joined Werner Kuhlbrandt's lab at EMBL and solved the first atomic structure of light harvesting complex II in its 2D crystalline forms by electron crystallography.6 Wei Xu () studied the bacteriophage prohead using cryo‐EM at Purdue University with Timothy Baker.7

index 2
data In the 1990s, a few research groups in China began to explore the application of EM in structure determination of biological macromolecules. Sen‐Fang Sui () at Tsinghua University led a small group of students to grow two‐dimensional crystals of proteins on lipid monolayers8 and studied their structures and interactions with membranes using TEM.9, 10 Wei Xu at the Institute of Biophysics (IBP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) investigated two‐dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Jing‐Qiang Zhang () at Sun Yat‐sen University and Qi‐Bin Yang () at Xiangtan University examined virus structures using cryo‐EM technology. Ke‐Hsin Kuo and Fanghua Li also dedicated a portion of their limited research funds to the development and application of cryo‐EM in addition to their major focus on materials science TEM. Facing meager research funding and the lack of high‐end instruments, these groups managed to build their own hardware and software tools for their pioneering research, published several cryo‐EM papers to report research carried out solely in China, and trained the first batch of graduate students. Many of these students, exemplified by Yifan Cheng (), later became successful scientists in the cryo‐EM field (Fig. 1).
index 3
data Since the year 2000, China has invested more resources in upgrading EM facilities and funding research projects in universities and research institutes. Well‐trained young scientists returned to China from a few leading cryo‐EM laboratories in the world and began their independent research careers at Tsinghua University, Peking University, Sun Yat‐sen University, University of Science and Technology of China, IBP of CAS, National Institute of Biological Sciences (NIBS), Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, and other academic institutions. The cryo‐EM research community gradually matured, bringing worldwide attention to rapid cryo‐EM development in China. In 2008, the First Kuo KH International Symposium of Cryo‐EM, co‐chaired by Da‐Neng Wang and Sen‐Fang Sui, was held successfully at Tsinghua University with more than 150 participants from all over the world. This event formally marked the beginning of a rapid rise of the cryo‐EM community in China. Since then, the Kuo KH International Symposium has become one of the most popular cryo‐EM meetings in the world.
index 4
data Between November 2002 and July 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic swept throughout the greater China region, with more than 8000 confirmed cases worldwide and a death toll of 672 in Hong Kong and mainland China. China was apparently unprepared for such a traumatic experience as the general public deserted shops and avoided gathering. During the process of identifying the disease causing agent and clinical treatment, the Chinese government keenly realized the importance of basic research in biology and medicine. In 2005, Zihe Rao (), then Director of the IBP, and Fuchu He (), then Vice‐President of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences (CAMMS) successfully lobbied the government to invest on basic research through construction of a centralized biological research facility. The Chinese Commission of Development and Reform, a de facto funding agency, decided to allocate 1.1 billion Chinese Yuan (about 130 million US Dollars then) on a National Protein Science Facility (the Facility). The original idea was to build a state‐of‐the‐art facility at IBP of CAS in Beijing, which scientists from China and all over the world would use for their cutting‐edge research. Due to the construction of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and other reasons, the leadership of CAS changed their mind in 2006 and proposed to build the Facility in Shanghai instead of Beijing. This change caused an uproar among scientists in Beijing, particularly those at CAMMS and Tsinghua.
index 5
data To retain the Facility in Beijing, Fuchu He approached Yigong Shi (), who had just began the relocation of his laboratory from Princeton to Beijing, and Zhixin Wang (), who joined the Tsinghua faculty after serving as the Director of IBP from 1999 to 2003. Together, Wang and Shi convinced the administration of Tsinghua University about the importance of retaining the Facility in Beijing, perhaps to a location conveniently accessible by scientists from Zhongguancun () and neighboring institutions. With strong support from the Ministry of Education and Beijing municipal government, Tsinghua University formed an alliance with CAMMS to compete with CAS for the right to build the Facility in Beijing instead of Shanghai. After several rounds of discussion, the final outcome was a compromised solution: the Chinese Commission of Development and Reform decided to split the funds evenly between Tsinghua/CAMMS and CAS in 2008. CAS would spend its share of 550 million Yuan on a facility in Shanghai (Shanghai Facility), located next to the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in the Pudong District. The Shanghai Facility received an additional allocation of approximately 200 million Yuan from the local government.
index 6
data The decision to split the Facility between two distant locations proved to be correct, because scientists in each location faced the competitive pressure to achieve higher scientific productivity and originality. In addition, the local governments competed to provide more financial support. The Beijing municipal government was more generous, providing 1:1 matching funds to the allotment from the central government and making the total investment 1.1 billion Chinese Yuan. Once the solution was reached between Tsinghua/CAMMS and CAS, Peking University and IBP asked to have a share of the Beijing Facility. It took some time for all parties to agree to a negotiated consensus. In the end, CAMMS had half of the total funds, with Tsinghua and Peking Universities splitting the remaining half. Despite its affiliation with CAS, IBP also received a small share of the funds that were earmarked for research instrument development. In the end, the Beijing Facility, also known as the Pilot Hub of Encyclopedic ProteomIX (PHOENIX), consists of three sites: a main location at CAMMS that focuses on proteomics, an arm on biological EM at Tsinghua, and a second arm on biological nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at Peking University. Binglin Gu (), a former President of Tsinghua University, vividly described the Beijing Facility as “one body and two wings,” or “,” where the body refers to CAMMS and two wings Tsinghua and Peking Universities.
index 7
data Assignment of the biological EM arm to Tsinghua University was anything but a random choice. At the beginning of the millennium, hard X‐ray free‐electron laser (XFEL) technology began to show promise as a powerful tool for structural elucidation of macromolecules. A large number of scientists from several disciplines had been lobbying the Chinese government for the construction of a national XFEL facility. Unfortunately, even under optimal circumstances, such an XFEL facility would be completed for operation no earlier than the year 2025 and thus offered little help to the ever‐increasing demands of structural biologists in China. Nonetheless, the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility—a third‐generation light source—was under construction in 2006, and Peking University had already built a national NMR facility with support from several branches of the central government. Thus, despite booming structural biology in China, complete absence of any high‐end TEM with field‐emission gun (FEG) for biological EM in 2007 formed a sharp contrast to the other two major methods of structure determination. Importantly, EM‐based methodologies—including single‐particle cryo‐EM, cryo‐electron tomography (cryo‐ET), and electron crystallography—had begun to show remarkable potential. In early 2007, a consensus was quickly reached among key scientists at Tsinghua—particularly Shi, Sui, and Wang—to build a centralized EM facility at Tsinghua. The University administration fully supported the decision. On behalf of Tsinghua, Sui delivered a proposal for such a facility to members of a review panel in May 2007.
index 8
data The Tsinghua Facility now has three Titan Krios, one Tecnai Arctica, one Tecnai F20, and three Tecnai Spirit TEMs (Table 1). All microscopes are fully operational. One of the three Titan Krios (Titan1) is equipped with a K2 Summit direct electron detector, and the other two Titan Krios (Titan2 and Titan3) will have their K2 detectors installed by Fall 2016. In addition, Titan2 has an energy filter, and Titan3 will have the most complete auxiliary components including an energy filter, an image Cs‐corrector, and a phase plate. The facility also has an FIB/SEM dual‐beam system equipped with a cryo‐SEM preparation workstation and a correlative light electron microscopy workflow. In addition to the microscopes, the facility has a complete set of cryo‐EM sample preparation equipment including high‐pressure freezers, freeze substitution systems, ultramicrotomes, freeze plungers, plasma cleaners, and high‐vacuum evaporators. An accompanying computing facility of 10,000 CPU cores and 10 PB storage has been installed and will be further expanded.
index 9
data The most important prerequisite for building a world‐class EM facility is to recruit top‐notch scientists. Coincidentally, three young scientists Haixiao Gao (), Jianlin Lei (), and Ning Gao (), all from the laboratory of Joachim Frank then at Wadsworth, wrote to Sui and Shi in May 2007, expressing a strong desire to build a unified laboratory at Tsinghua University. Jianlin Lei, trained in physics at both undergraduate and PhD levels, has strengths in EM instrumentation and methodology. Ning Gao has rich experience with protein biochemistry and EM sample preparation. Haixiao Gao had received comprehensive training in cryo‐EM and was the leader of the trio. Shi interviewed the team in Room 418 of the Schultz Laboratory at Princeton University, where Haixiao Gao gave an impressive presentation on behalf of all three. As the only interviewer, Shi was convinced of the ambitious EM‐based research plan presented by Gao and formally invited the three to apply for tenure‐track faculty positions at Tsinghua University. After a prearranged interview, the three were simultaneously offered independent positions, with ample start‐up funds.
index 10
data Haixiao Gao included a Titan Krios microscope as a must‐have item on her list of requirements. The price tag of approximately 4 to 5 million US dollars, or approximately 35 million Chinese Yuan, was an astronomical number to Tsinghua University. With strong support from Zhixin Wang and Sen‐Fang Sui, Shi turned to the Tsinghua University administration for help in early May 2008. The possibility of installing Asia's first operational Titan Krios on Tsinghua campus and the huge research potential convinced the leadership, which decided to make an investment of 30 million Yuan after listening to a brief presentation by Shi. These funds were supposed to cover both the purchase, room preparation, and the operation of the Titan microscope. Facing a gap of funds, Shi et al. had to negotiate with FEI to lower the purchase price. Gratifyingly, within 2 weeks of the very first meeting with the FEI team, Shi signed a formal Titan Krios purchasing contract on behalf of Tsinghua University in June 2008. This Titan Krios microscope (Titan1) arrived in early March 2009 and became fully operational in June, the first in Asia.
index 11
data To fully utilize the first Titan Krios microscope in China and Asia, Tsinghua decided to recruit additional faculty members in cryo‐EM. Hong‐Wei Wang () performed his PhD thesis research on cryo‐EM in the laboratory of Sen‐Fang Sui and received his postdoctoral training with Eva Nogales at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Wang received several excellent job offers including one from Tsinghua in 2008 but chose to begin his independent career at Yale University instead. Convinced by Shi of the once‐in‐a‐lifetime opportunity to build a world‐class cryo‐EM facility, Wang returned to Tsinghua in 2011 and quickly became a major driving force behind Tsinghua's continued effort of hiring EM faculty members and expanding the EM facility. Ye Xiang (), a postdoctoral scientist with Michael Rossmann at Purdue University, was recruited to Tsinghua in 2013. Xueming Li (), a postdoctoral fellow with Yifan Cheng at UCSF and an inventor of the semiautomated low‐dose acquisition program UCSF‐Image4 and the motion correction program MotionCorr,11 joined Tsinghua in 2014. Jiawei Wang (), a classically trained X‐ray crystallographer, shifted his research focus to EM data analysis. A critical mass on EM methodology and application began to take shape at Tsinghua. Such a build‐up would have been flawless if it were not for the unexpected and sudden departure of Haixiao Gao at the beginning of 2010.
index 12
data The emergence of direct electron detectors has fundamentally changed the impact of EM on the various biological research fields. Soon after the operation of Titan1 at Tsinghua, IBP and the Shanghai Facility installed their own 300 kV Titan Krios microscopes, each recently upgraded with a K2 direct electron detector (Table 1). The bright prospects of EM‐based research spread rapidly in China, with a number of institutions quickly committed to the purchase of 300 kV cryo‐TEMs. These institutions include Fudan University and Shanghai Tech University in Shanghai, Peking University, Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, Sichuan University in Chengdu, Wuhan University, Xiamen University, Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, and the Institute of Pathogen Biology of CAS (Table 1). IBP has recently ordered a second Titan Krios microscope. In most places, accompanying microscopes operating at 200 kV and/or 120 kV have also been planned. A number of other institutions have already purchased or plan to purchase a 200 kV cryo‐TEM and are keen to the possibility of purchasing a 300 kV cryo‐TEM. Currently, there are seven TEMs operating at 300 kV in mainland China, of which five are Titan Krios (Table 1). The number of Titan Krios and equivalent 300 kV microscopes in operation is likely to reach double digits in China by the end of 2017, when the total number of operational cryo‐TEMs will exceed 50.

data Xueming Li had worked on EM for materials science in his early career. In 2009, he changed his research field to structural biology with the specific aims of improving the efficiency and resolution of biological cryo‐EM. Obtaining a large number of particles to boost the overall signal‐to‐noise ratio and enhancing signal recording efficiency at high frequency are two key strategies for achieving atomic resolutions in cryo‐EM. As a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Yifan Cheng at UCSF, Li introduced the general purpose graphic processing unit (GPGPU) into 3D reconstruction17 and developed the data collection system named UCSFImage.11 These efforts resulted in the acceleration of single‐particle cryo‐EM data processing by more than 10‐fold. His studies on a new generation of detector (i.e., electron counting camera), and a new motion correction procedure, greatly facilitate cryo‐EM reconstruction of small biomolecules at near atomic resolution.18, 19 Since joining Tsinghua University in the spring of 2014, Li has focused on the development of new methods and technologies, aiming to make atomic‐resolution cryo‐EM analysis more accessible and convenient for a wide range of biological samples. Relying on the deep learning algorithm, Li and his collaborators, Jianyang Zeng () and Tian Xia (), have developed a fully automated particle‐picking program (Table 2).20

data Fei Sun () of IBP has been collaborating with Fa Zhang () of the Institute of Computation Technology, CAS, to build an automatic pipeline for high‐resolution electron tomography (ET). They developed a feature‐based tilt series alignment algorithm ATOM_align21 for plastic section ET and a fiducial marker‐based tilt series algorithm MarkerAuto22 for cryo‐ET. To improve the contrast and quality of ET reconstruction, they developed three different reconstruction algorithms: ASART,23 FIRT,24 and ICON.25 Notably, ICON combines both nonuniform fast Fourier transformation and compressed sensing techniques and significantly recovers the missing information in both the angular intervals and the missing wedge.

data The organization and dynamics of the 30 nm chromatin fiber play a critical role in regulating DNA accessibility for gene transcription. Ping Zhu () of IBP started his cryo‐EM training as a postdoctoral fellow at Florida State University in 1999. He had been working on the structures of envelope glycoproteins (ENV) on the surface of AIDS viruses26, 27 before returning to IBP. Primarily using cryo‐EM, Zhu seeks to understand the molecular mechanism of viral assembly, infection, and replication, and the higher order structure of 30 nm chromatin fiber. Zhu et al. determined the cryo‐EM structure of 30 nm chromatin fiber reconstituted from 12 nucleosome arrays at a resolution of 11 Å (Table 2)28. The in vitro reconstituted 30 nm chromatin fibers are organized as a left‐handed double helix twisted by repeating tetranucleosome units in an H1‐dependent manner. These results provide critical insights into fundamental structural aspects of the chromatin fiber and constitute an important step toward understanding of how chromatin fiber is organized and regulated.

data Jijie Chai () is interested in mechanistic understanding of the nucleotide‐binding domain (NBD)‐ and leucine‐rich repeat (LRR)‐containing proteins (NLRs), which are crucial for the cytosolic immunosurveillance system of mammals.29, 30 NLRs function as pattern recognition receptors to perceive pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or host‐derived danger components. This results in the formation of high‐molecular‐weight complexes termed inflammasomes that activate the proinflammatory caspases‐1. Recognition of bacterial pathogens by NLR apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs) induces activation of NLR family CARD domain‐containing protein 4 (NLRC4) followed by formation of the NAIP‐NLRC4 inflammasomes.31, 32 Recent cryo‐EM studies33, 34 of the mouse Naip2‐Nlrc4 inflammasome provide the first view of how inflammasomes are assembled and activated (Table 2). In the cryo‐EM structures, the complex formed a wheel‐like architecture containing 10 or 11 Nlrc4 protomers; however, only one Naip2 molecule was incorporated into the complex. Structural comparison between an inactive Nlrc435 and the activated Nlrc4 suggests a model for the activation of the Naip2‐Nlrc4 inflammasome, in which Nlrc4, once activated by Naip2, exposes a previously hidden surface for interaction with a solvent‐exposed receptor surface of an inactive Nlrc4, leading to Nlrc4 self‐activation.

data Yigong Shi has been working on intramembrane proteases since 2005. X‐ray crystallography was employed to solve the structures of the serine protease rhomboid and the zinc metalloprotease S2P.36, 37 The ultimate target is human γ‐secretase, which comprises the catalytic component presenilin and three additional membrane proteins. Human γ‐secretase is intricately linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and most AD‐derived missense mutations map to presenilin.38 Although the archeal homolog of presenilin was bagged by X‐ray crystallography,39 the intact γ‐secretase defied many years of crystallization attempt. The calculated molecular weight of γ‐secretase is only about 160 kDa, a challenging size for cryo‐EM analysis. Through a close collaboration between the Shi laboratory at Tsinghua and Xiaochen Bai and Sjors Scheres at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of MRC, the structure of γ‐secretase was determined at an overall resolution of 3.4 Å (Table 2).40 The vast majority of the side chains within the membrane exhibit unambiguous EM density for specific assignment. Atomic modeling of human γ‐secretase allows mechanistic understanding of functions and disease‐derived mutations.

data Nieng Yan () seeks to elucidate the structural mechanism of the Na+ and Ca2+ channels in the excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling of skeletal and cardiac muscles, including the voltage‐gated Na+ and Ca2+ (Nav and Cav) channels and the ryanodine receptor RyRs.41 The Nav channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potential in excitable membranes. The action potential‐induced conformational changes of Cav1.1 activate RyR1, releasing Ca2+ from sarcoplasm into cytoplasm. In contrast, RyR2 is activated by the Cav1.2‐permeated Ca2+ influx, a mechanism known as calcium‐induced calcium release (CICR). Yan et al. determined the crystal structure of a bacterial Nav channel NavRh in a potentially inactivated state (Table 2).42 The homotetrameric NavRh exhibits asymmetry in the selectivity filter and the voltage‐sensing domains (VSDs) in the structure. Using cryo‐EM, Yan's group elucidated structures of the rabbit Cav1.1 channel complex at resolutions ranging from 4.3 to 3.6 Å.43, 44 The structures exhibit conformational shifts and reveal mechanistic insights into voltage‐dependent structural changes of the Cav channels. In collaboration with Yigong Shi and Sjors Scheres, Yan's group also determined the cryo‐EM structures of the rabbit RyR1 at near‐atomic resolutions in closed states and 5.7 Å resolution in the open state (Table 2).45, 46 The dilation of the cytoplasmic gate is induced by the conformational changes of the adjoining Central domain, which represents the major transducer in the long‐range allosteric gating of RyRs.46 These structures lay a solid foundation for mechanistic understanding of the E–C coupling and the function and disease mechanism of Nav and Cav channels.

data Trained as an X‐ray crystallographer, Maojun Yang () began to use cryo‐EM to study membrane proteins since 2010. Mechanosensitive channels are unique membrane transporters that are activated by mechanical forces and transport specific molecules down a concentration gradient across a membrane. Mouse Piezo1 is the first mechanosensitive channel found in mammals47 and has broad functions in many physiological processes relating to mechanical forces. In close collaboration with Ning Gao and Bailong Xiao at Tsinghua, Yang determined the cryo‐EM structure of Piezo1 at 4.8 Å resolution (Table 2).48 In contrast to the prediction of a homotetramer, Piezo1 forms a trimeric propeller‐like structure, with three distal blades forming the extracellular domains and a central cap constituting the transmembrane domain which includes 42 transmembrane helices. This structure shed exciting new light on the functional mechanism of mechanosensitive channels.

data In plant photosynthesis, a series of supramolecular machineries embedded in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast mediate the initial biochemical reactions driven by light energy. Among them, photosystem II (PSII) is the most upstream machinery capable of converting light energy and splitting water molecules under ambient temperature. PSII is powered by a series of peripheral light‐harvesting complexes termed LHCII. As a graduate student, Zhenfeng Liu () in the laboratory of Wenrui Chang () at the IBP solved the first X‐ray structure of plant major LHCII.49 However, little was known about how the LHCII complexes assemble with the PSII core complexes at specific locations, so as to deliver excitation energy efficiently. Through close collaborations with Xinzheng Zhang and Mei Li at the IBP, Liu determined the structure of spinach PSII–LHCII supercomplex at 3.2 Å resolution using single‐particle cryo‐EM (Table 2).50 This unveiled intricate innerworkings of a 1.1 MDa homodimeric supramolecular system containing 50 protein subunits, 210 chlorophylls, 56 carotenoids, and many other cofactors. The energy transfer pathways between three different LHCII complexes and the PSII core are suggested.

data Ning Gao is interested in ribosome biogenesis and since 2008 has been employing cryo‐EM to study the dynamic ribosome assembly pathways51, 52 and the roles of various assembly factors.53, 54, 55 In particular, eukaryotic ribosome assembly is orchestrated by hundreds of auxiliary factors, making it an ideal system to fully explore the powerful potential of cryo‐EM. With the recent hardware and software breakthroughs in the field, Gao et al. have obtained a series of structures of the endogenous premature ribosomal particles isolated from yeast nuclei, and one specific state was solved at an overall resolution of 3.0 Å (Table 2).56 This structure enabled atomic modeling of over 20 assembly factors, which provide a structural framework for understanding the diverse roles of pre‐60S assembly factors. Gao also uses cryo‐EM as a primary tool to study the function of less‐characterized ribosome‐binding proteins in translation control, such as the ribosome‐associated cotranslational chaperones57 and heat‐shock‐induced ribosome‐splitting factor HflX.58

data The genetic material DNA is first transcribed into precursor messenger RNA (pre‐mRNA) by eukaryotic RNA polymerase. Pre‐mRNA undergoes splicing by the spliceosome to generate mature mRNA, which is translated into protein by the ribosome. The spliceosome is a multi‐mega‐Dalton ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, with its components undergoing rapid flux during each cycle of pre‐mRNA splicing. Compared to the relatively stable structures of RNA polymerase and the ribosome (both determined by X‐ray crystallography), the spliceosome exhibits exceptional conformational flexibility and compositional dynamics. Relying on about 200,000 particles, the Shi laboratory determined the structure of an intact spliceosome from the yeast S. pombe at an overall resolution of 3.6 Å (Table 2).59, 60 This structure was followed up with near‐atomic cryo‐EM structures of the S. cerevisiae spliceosome at two distinct states of the pre‐mRNA splicing cycle.61, 62 Together with the structures of the U4/U6.U5 tri‐snRNP,63, 64 the molecular mechanisms of the yeast spliceosome are documented at unprecedented clarity.

data One of the major focuses by Hong‐Wei Wang has been the structure and mechanism of macromolecules involved in RNA metabolism. He revealed the architecture of yeast RNA degradation exosome complex using single particle EM65 and later discovered the presence of two distinct routes within the complex for RNA substrate recruitment.66 In a recent study, Wang et al. pushed the resolution of the exosome complex to near‐atomic and discovered an interaction mode of Ski7 protein with the entire complex as well as structural elements involved in RNA substrate‐induced conformational switch of the complex.67 Wang et al. determined the architecture of human Dicer and RISC‐loading complex in the RNA interference pathway.68 Using the phase‐plate cryo‐EM technology, his group revealed the various conformational states of human Dicer induced by specific RNA substrates and cofactors (Table 2).69 He also solved the long‐sought structure of the group II intron RNA in complex with its intron‐encoded reverse transcriptase at near‐atomic resolution, which reveals the mechanism of intron self‐splicing and has implications for both the spliceosome and telomerase.70

data Ye Xiang of Tsinghua University has been working on virus structures using a combination of X‐ray crystallography and cryo‐EM. The bacterial virus phi29 is an ∼15 MDa asymmetric complex system consisting of ∼9 components in different copies varying from several to several hundreds. Xiang used X‐ray crystallography to solve the structure of each individual component71, 72, 73, 74 and cryo‐EM to determine the structures of complex viral particles at different states (Table 2).74, 75 The ultimate goal is to obtain atomic details of the whole complex at different states, including the prohead, the mature virion, and the postinfection virion. Such structural information may help decipher the mechanisms of the viral capsid assembly, genome packaging, host cell recognition, host cell wall and membrane penetration, and genome release. Ping Zhu of IBP determined the cryo‐EM structures of a cypovirus virus (CPV) in its nontranscribing state at 3.9 Å resolution76 and in the transcribing state at 4.1 Å,77 which provide a detailed glimpse into the transcription process (Table 2). Fei Sun studied the structure of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) that belongs to Lagovirus, a branch of calicivirus. The cryo‐EM structure of RHDV was solved to 6.5 Å resolution with the core region at 5.5 Å, which enabled modeling of a semi atomic model and identification of the N‐terminal arm of the capsid protein that was unavailable in the crystal structure.78

data Qinfen Zhang () of Sun Yat‐sen University has used cryo‐EM to analyze protein complexes79 as well as the icosahedral viruses that infect plant, fish, and crab.80 These studies yield clues for vaccine and medicine design. Although the structures of icosahedral viral capsids have been studied for about 50 years, the precise structures of genome and associated proteins within viral capsid remained unknown. Hongrong Liu () of Hunan Normal University and Lingpeng Cheng () of Tsinghua University collaborated to resolve this question using single‐particle cryo‐EM analysis in combination with their newly developed method for the symmetry‐mismatch reconstruction of icosahedral virus.81 The 3D structures of the dsRNA genome and the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerases were reconstructed within both transcribing and nontranscribing cypovirus capsid, revealing a dynamic process during virus transcription and challenging the conventional view on the packaging of dsRNA virus genomes inside the rigid capsid. Yao Cong () of the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology has focused on the protein folding nanomachine TRiC/CCT as well as virus–antibody complexes. In close collaboration with Zhong Huang at the Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Cong has resolved the near‐atomic resolution cryo‐EM structure of human enterovirus 71 (EV71) in complex with the Fab of a bivalent broadly neutralizing antibody.82 The Cong laboratory is also developing the sampling reduced FRM2D method to further accelerate the speed of image alignment.

data The Chinese biological cryo‐EM community has expanded tremendously in the last decade, from a few independent laboratories in 2005 to more than 2 dozens in 2015 (Fig. 2). This remarkable expansion is paralleled by the timely procurement of advanced TEMs and fueled by the revolution in camera technology in recent years. There was no 200 kV cryo‐TEM with FEG in China in 2008; but 17 cryo‐TEMs with FEG were in service operating at 200 or 300 kV by the end of June 2016 (Table 1). The research output, as measured by publications in top‐notch journals, has increased drastically. Since 2014, 18 original research articles from China, each reporting the cryo‐EM structure of a biological macromolecule, were published in the global weekly journals Nature and Science (Table 2). Although cryo‐EM has also enjoyed a rapid and healthy growth in the other countries, the growth rate of cryo‐EM in China far exceeds that of the world average. This trend is expected to continue for an additional period of 5–10 years.
index 27
data The development of biological EM in China is strongly tilted toward application, particularly single‐particle cryo‐EM analysis of supramolecular complexes, which brings an immediate and significant impact on the biological research community worldwide. The flip side of emphasizing application is reflected by apparent weakness in EM methodological development in China, which will likely restrict applications at the forefront of the EM field if left unaddressed. In addition, there is an ostensible paucity of research activity using cryo‐ET in China. These deficiencies would be tolerable for a small nation or a region, but not for a huge country like China that is motivated to play a key role in the evolving research field of biological EM. Thankfully, the Chinese biological cryo‐EM community has keenly recognized these shortcomings and is working hard to improve the situation.

data Since its inception, X‐ray crystallography has played an instrumental role in our understanding of the biological world.83 Owing to its mature methodology, X‐ray crystallography has become a powerful, routine technology for nonspecialists and contributes to the vast majority of the detailed structural information in the protein data bank (PDB). There is no doubt that X‐ray crystallography will continue to play an important role in our quest to understand the microscopic world. But the relative roles of X‐ray crystallography versus EM have already changed and the trend of such changes is likely to accelerate in the coming years. In 2005, the weighted overall contribution to structural biology by cryo‐EM probably represented 1% of that by X‐ray crystallography; in 2015, the number was perhaps 80%. Although it is very difficult to predict the scenario in 2025, we would not be surprised if the relative contribution by these two methodologies reciprocates relative to that in 2005. Thankfully, those of us who used to rely exclusively on X‐ray crystallography are increasingly inclined to turn to EM for tackling research problems. We are optimistic that the biological EM community will greatly benefit from the joining of the X‐ray crystallography experts.

data For the past two decades, pandemics of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) have been serious threats to global health, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Reassorted novel strains of influenza viruses and coronaviruses continue to arise, rendering vaccinations - if developed - less useful and posing increased risks to humans. Two prominent viruses – 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) – have markedly affected humans. H1N1, since the 2009 pandemic, has caused about 284,500 deaths, both directly via respiratory infections and indirectly from the cardiovascular diseases secondary to bacterial infections.1 In addition, MERS-CoV, since its first emergence in 2012, has infected 1600 individuals, causing 574 deaths and was reported in 26 countries although the vast majority of reported cases originated from the Arabian Peninsula.2
index 0
data H1N1 and MERS-CoV both target the respiratory tract, and share many similar clinical symptoms. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat3-8 followed always by gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.3,7-9 Both diseases often lead to complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, organ failure, and even death.4,6,9 Complications mostly lie within the respiratory system with organ failure commonly noted in the respiratory system, followed by renal and cardiovascular systems.5 Individuals infected with H1N1 usually belong to those aged between 21 and 50 years,4,5 and have a mean age in the early 40s.3,5 MERS-CoV, on the other hand, mostly infects older adults with a median age of 50 years.10 This difference was hypothesized to be related to the development of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza viruses from previous exposures to seasonal influenza in elder people.5 Another difference between H1N1 and MERS-CoV relates to the length of the incubation period. H1N1 has a short incubation period between 1 and 2 days,11 whereas MERS-CoV has a much longer period of ~5 days.10
index 1
data Many infected individuals exhibit comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and obesity), rendering them more susceptible to complications.3-7 Diabetes is one of the known documented contributing host-related risk factor in both H1N1 and MERS-CoV severe cases, and is frequent in individuals developing fatal disease complications.4-7 This observation may suggest an etiological relationship between diabetes and acute viral respiratory infections. Diabetes and its related conditions downregulate the innate and humoral immune systems by reducing the function of T cells and neutrophils.12 Hyperglycemia impairs critical components of innate immunity in vitro, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and the bactericidal activity of neutrophils and macrophages and lead to secondary infections.13 The direct influence of diabetes, however, on acute respiratory infections still needs more research to estimate the frequency of diabetes in severe viral conditions and to elucidate the etiologic role on diabetes in disease severity.14 The present study was undertaken to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature to describe the prevalence of diabetes in two of the emerging severe acute respiratory infections such as H1N1 and MERS-CoV and to explore its possible contribution to the severity and complication of the two viral conditions.
index 2
data A search was conducted in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and Embase Classic databases to the last week of July 2015 using the search terms (MeSH) H1N1 or MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and Diabetes. The search resulted in 123 articles selected for title and abstract review as they satisfied our selection criteria (see below). We limited the studies into those in humans and excluded reports published as review articles, letters, case studies, editorials, conference abstracts, vaccination trials or family-based studies. After eliminating duplicate listings and only considering articles in full text, a total of 44 peer-reviewed original studies were selected for full text review. Full article review resulted in the further exclusion of 8 reports that were not documenting the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 or MERS-CoV (i.e., no association studies), examining only a small number of travellers as a case report (n=2 subjects), reporting seasonal influenza alone, reviewing already reported cases (MERS-CoV), or simply documenting national surveys. A bibliography search of the remaining articles identified two additional studies. A total of 38 peer- reviewed articles (29 studies for H1N13-5,14-39 and 9 for MERS-CoV6-9,40-44) were identified for this article (Figure 1).
index 3
data The abstracts of the identified studies were independently reviewed by two readers (AB and SJ). Differences were resolved through discussions for a consensus to be reached. Percentage agreement and Cohen’s Kappa (k) statistic45 were calculated and interpreted in accordance with Landis and Koch’s benchmarks46 for assessing the agreement between reviewers as poor (<0), slight (0.0-0.20), fair (0.21-0.40), moderate (0.41-0.60), substantial (0.61-0.80), and excellent (0.81-1.0). The agreement on the inclusion between the two reviewers was 86%, with k=0.72 (95% CI 0.58-0.85).
index 4
data The methodological quality of each study was evaluated as previously described47 with some modification. Quality of the study was based on four criteria: (a) the number of study subjects (n; at least the median of 157 for H1N1 and 17 for MERS-CoV), (b) comprehensive reporting of patients’ demographic information, (c) describing a minimum of 3 disease-associated symptoms and (d) reporting at least 2 comorbidities (in addition to diabetes). For each criterion, each study was given a score (0 or 1, with 1 fulfilling the criteria). The total score was calculated for each study (score range 0-4). Quality scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 were considered poor, fair, good and very good, respectively.
index 5
data Data extracted from the selected studies included the first author’s name, publication date, country, dates of recruitment, ethnicity, total sample size (divided to males and females), age, prevalence of symptoms (including fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, APACHEII) and percentage of comorbidities at the time of presentation (including obesity, immunosuppression or HIV and heart conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and/or coronary arterial diseases) (Tables 1 and 2). Weighted average was used to calculate the average age and the overall prevalence of clinical symptoms and comorbidities. Publication bias was assessed both by the visual inspection of funnel plot (Figure 2) and by Egger’s test. Egger’s test is widely used to assess the tendency for the effects estimated in small sample size studies to differ from those estimated in larger studies. The results of Egger’s test are presented in terms of bias coefficient. To measure the prevalence of diabetes in the two viral conditions, we extracted the proportion of the disease in the reported cases of severe respiratory infections. A subgroup analysis was carried out by region, only for the H1N1 studies (Table 3). Region subgroup analysis for MERS-CoV was not doable since all the identified studies were conducted on Saudi populations, with one study of pooled analysis where region/country designation was not possible. The primary outcome measure was to evaluate the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases. The meta-analysis of proportions (and 95% CIs) was calculated for the identified studies (Figure 3) and in a subgroup analysis within each region (Table 3). Meta-analysis tests were conducted using the OpenMeta Analyst version 10.10, a free, cross-platform, open-source program.48 We used binary random-effects model since we assumed that the relationship between diabetes and severe respiratory infection is varied across populations. T-test was used to compare between average age in H1N1 and MERS-CoV since this factor was normally distributed in the two sets of studies. Mann-Whitney Utest was employed to compare the prevalence of clinical symptoms and comorbidities between the two diseases as these conditions were not normally distributed. To assess whether there is true heterogeneity among the selected studies and that all the studies are evaluating the same effect, we used the Q test.49
Q test only informs about the presence versus the absence of heterogeneity and does not report on the extent of such heterogeneity. Therefore, we calculated the I2 index to complement the Q test and quantify the degree of heterogeneity among studies.50 Given the poor power of Q test to detect true heterogeneity among a small number of studies, we also quantified the true heterogeneity by estimating the between-study variance in the random-effects model (τ2), as previously described.51 P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV severity from the selected studies and to inspect the heterogeneity of the individual findings.
index 6
data The present systematic review examines the relationship between diabetes and the H1N1 and MERS-CoV. A total of 38 studies that report the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 (n=92,948 cases from 29 studies, Table 1) and MERS-CoV (n=308 cases from 9 studies, Table 2) were selected. The funnel plot (Figure 2) demonstrated a non-symmetrical distribution of the effect size of each study on either side of the pooled estimate. This seemingly non-symmetrical appearance of the plot suggested evidence of publication bias. Egger’s test also supported this notion particularly in MERS-CoV studies where the bias coefficient was not statistically significant - given the assumption for evidence of small-study effects is based on P<0.1 (P=0.13 for the H1N1 studies and P=0.065 for the MERS-CoV studies). These findings are supported by the significant heterogeneity (P<0.001) among the selected studies (see below). According to our quality scoring criteria (see above), the majority of the studies were between fair (score 2; 12 reports) and good (score 3, 16 reports) quality with 7 studies that fulfilled all quality scoring criteria (score 4, very good). Within the selected studies, sex-ratio (male:female) in the majority of the H1N1 reports was 1:1 whereas it was ~2:1 in the MERS-CoV cases. The average age of H1N1 cases (36.2±6.0 years, range: 11-54.5 years) was significantly younger than MERS-CoV cases (54.3±7.4 years, range: 36-66 years, t-test P=0.0004). The prevalence of fever, shortness of breath, sore throat and cough was not statistically different between H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases from the two sets of studies (Mann-Whitney U test at P<0.05). We observed a non-statistically significant ~2-fold higher frequency of obesity (>30 kg/m2) in the MERS-CoV patients compared to their H1N1 counterparts (17.6±4.2 vs. 7.7±2.8%). The combined frequencies of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and cardio-artillery diseases were ~3-fold higher in MERS-CoV cases than in H1N1 (31.3±5.9% vs. 7.2±2.7, P=0.0004).
index 7
data Meta-analyses for the proportion of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The overall proportion of diabetes in H1N1 is 15% (95% CI: 12-17%), 3.6-fold lower than its proportion in MERS-CoV (54%, 95%CI: 28-80%). The two sets of studies displayed a significant heterogeneity (P<0.001) among the selected studies (Q test: 1943 for H1N1 vs. 169.8 for MERS-CoV). Additionally, the degree of heterogeneity among studies was statistically significant (P<0.001) and comparable between the two sets of studies (I2 index: 98.6 for H1N1 vs. 95.3 for MERS-CoV). The between-study variance in the random-effects model was markedly lower among the H1N1 studies (τ2=0.003) than the MERS-CoV reports (τ2=0.134).
index 8
data Subgroup analysis by region for H1N1 studies (Table 3) showed that the frequency of diabetes in H1N1 from Asia and North America (~18-20%, P<0.001) is 2-fold higher than its prevalence in the cases recruited from Europe and South America (~10%, P<0.001). Cases from Africa (14%) showed a non-significant slightly lower diabetes prevalence compared to those from Asia and North America. It should be noted however, that the frequency estimate from Africa was developed only from two studies (compared to 8 and 10 studies from Asia and North America, respectively, and 4 studies from each of Europe and South America). The heterogeneity tests for the studies included in all regional sub-analyses exhibited significant overall heterogeneity (Q test, P≤0.009), degree of heterogeneity among studies (I2 index) and between-study variance in the random-effects model (τ2 test).
index 9
data The present systematic review evaluates the frequency of diabetes in SARI conditions such as H1N1 and MERS-CoV. We observed a large difference between the volume of literature and total number of subjects evaluated for each condition and identified 29 studies for H1N1 (with 92,948 subjects) and 9 for MERS-CoV (with 308 patients). About 60% of the selected studies (23 out of 38) had a quality score between good and very good (Tables 1 and 2). This indicates that a large set of the studies had a sufficient enough number subjects to substantiate the outcome and have provided a comprehensive reporting of patients’ demographic information. Furthermore, the majority of the selected studies reported a set of disease-associated symptoms and comorbidities that permitted developing a comprehensive profile of the infectious disease and its complication. This difference reflects the discrepancy between the two diseases in their global (H1N1) versus regional (MERS-CoV) spread, and the period during which they emerged. Immediately following its outbreak in 2009, the H1N1 triple reassortant swine influenza viruses contained genes from avian, swine, and human influenza A viruses53,54 and sustained a rapid between-human transmission to spread globally.52 On the other hand, in 2012, the emergence of MERS-CoV was to a great extent contained within the Arabian Peninsula55 and dromedary camels were identified as the intermediate host56 with a closely related virus sequences found in bats.57 Apart from a number of nosocomial outbreaks involving healthcare workers caring for MERS-CoV patients; little evidence has been initially reported for sustained person-to-person transmission.58 However, during the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea it was demonstrated that among 186 cases, 83.2% of the transmission events were linked to only 5 super-spreaders, all of whom had pneumonia at presentation and contacted hundreds of people, adding evidence to the person-to-person transmission in MERS-CoV.59

data The characteristic pattern of transmission and spread of H1N1 and MERS-CoV may have resulted in a distinctive sex-ratio for each condition. MERS-CoV cases exhibited a sex-ratio (male:female) of 2:1, twice that noted for H1N1 cases (Tables 1 and 2). The male predominance of MERS-CoV reflects the higher likelihood of exposure to the infectious agent in males than in females in Middle Eastern cultures. In addition, most males who tested positive for the virus and died also had underlying medical conditions, which could explain the severity of cases in older males.60 In agreement, MERS-CoV cases were significantly older (54.3±7.4 years) than their H1N1 (36.2±6.0 years) counterparts. The average age of H1N1 patients is similar to that in H5N1 cases where 90 percent of the subjects were 40 years or younger.61 As noted with H5N1 cases, it can be estimated that 15-20% of elder people may have residual immunity against this H1N1 flu strain following their life-time exposures to multiple influenza outbreaks.61-64 This immunogenicity does not apply to coronaviruses and may explain the younger average age of H1N1 cases compared to MERS-CoV cases. Indeed, it was proposed over 60 years ago that repeated exposures to antigenic variants of influenza viruses may result in antibodies recognizing a large number of common flu antigens, and develop a reinforced immunity that lower the risk of infection with newly emerging variants.65

data The clinical presentations of SARI generally include respiratory symptoms, such as fever, new onset or exacerbation of cough, breathing difficulty and sore throat. Severe illnesses may vary from pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, encephalitis, myocarditis, or other severe and life-threatening complications.66 The frequency of fever, shortness of breath, sore throat and cough was similar between H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases. In contrast, underlying medical conditions and comorbidities varied significantly between the two viral conditions. Patients with MERS-CoV had 2-fold higher rates of obesity (P>0.05) and 3-fold higher combined frequencies of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and cardio-artillery diseases (P<0.05) (Tables 1 and 2). The varying rates of comorbidities between H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases may relate to their different patterns of regional spread. Cardiovascular diseases are highly prevalent in the Middle East67 than in many regions of the world.67,68 This observation also applies to obesity, although the lower prevalence of obesity in males from the Arabian Peninsula versus females69 and their higher predominance in MERS-CoV patients (see above) together may have been combined to render the occurrence of obesity in MERS-CoV non-significantly different from that in H1N1. The increased risk of developing severe H1N1 and MERS-CoV complications in people with underlying chronic diseases was similarly reported in seasonal influenza. A recent study noted that, compared to subjects with no comorbidities, severe cases of influenza are more likely to manifest with obesity (OR for mortality 2.74, 95%CI: 1.56-4.80), cardiovascular diseases (2.92, 1.76-4.86), hypertension (1.49, 1.10-2.01) and neuromuscular disease (2.68, 1.91-3.75).70 More studies examining the link between SARI and metabolic syndrome-related complications such as obesity and cardiovascular conditions are needed to evaluate their contribution to the severity of infectious diseases.

data The overall proportion of diabetes was ~4-fold higher in MERS-CoV cases (54%) than in their H1N1 counterparts (15%) (Figures 3 and 4). In agreement, odds ratio for severe H1N1 in diabetic subjects (ranging from 2.2 to 4.4)16,19,23,30 was >3-fold lower than for severe MERS-CoV (OR ranging from 7.2 to 15.7).9,40 Although at varying extents, these findings implicate diabetes as a risk factor for sever MERS-CoV and H1N1. One reason for this difference may relate to the higher average age of MERS-CoV cases given that older age is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes.71 Although in younger Middle Eastern populations rates of diabetes and its risk factors67 are higher than those in older populations, the disease prevalence has increased across all age groups rather than just in older adults in the region.72 Another possible explanation can be attributed to the high prevalence of diabetes in the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula67 - where MERS-CoV originated and spread - compared to its prevalence in other world regions.68 Similar increased rates of tuberculosis were noted in regions with high diabetes prevalence.73 Additionally, subgroup analysis by region demonstrated that diabetes frequency in H1N1 cases from Asia and North America is ~2-fold higher than in those from Europe and South America (Table 3). This coincides with the high prevalence of diabetes in Asia and North America (~12%) compared to Europe or South and Central America (~9%).74 However, despite the lines of evidence suggesting an influence of the region of viral spread on diabetes proportion in the severe cases of SARI, the rate of diabetes in MERS-CoV was still ~3-fold higher than that in the H1N1 cases from Asia (17.6%, 95% CI: 12.1-23.1; P<0.001; Table 3) - where diabetes rates are comparable to those in the regions of MERS-CoV. This observation suggests that the higher prevalence of diabetes in MERS-CoV cases than in H1N1, may not be simply related to the regional differences in the viral spread and that an etiologic role of diabetes in severe MERS-CoV cases may exist distinctive from that in H1N1.
index 13
data Diabetes can impair the innate immune system75 and render individuals more susceptible to a range of infectious diseases and severe illnesses.13,75,76 For example, during seasonal influenza outbreaks, compared to healthy subjects, diabetic patients were shown to have 6-fold higher risk of becoming critically ill and acquire hospitalization with 4-fold increased rates of pneumonia-related hospitalizations and a 3-fold elevated likelihood of dying of complications.77 Diabetes share several common features with infectious disorders and its complication such as the endothelial dysfunction, the pro-inflammatory state and the attenuation of innate immune response.75 The cytokine overload related to the Th1 (microbicidal action of IFN- ) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory IL-4, -5, -10 and -13) shift in severe viral infection when accompanied by the increased cytokine levels arising from diabetes, both can be detrimental to the endothelium and lead to a range of subsequent complications.78 Dampened innate immunity and the shift from Th1 to Th2 responses were implicated in linking the high prevalence of allergy observed in fatal viral infections, e.g., Dengue fever.79 Furthermore, diabetes can impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions with a subsequent status of reduced immune response76 where individuals become at increased risk of severe infectious disease outcome. In support, diabetes-associated hyperglycemia and cellular insulinopenia are known to impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions with a subsequent status of reduced immune response.76 Furthermore, levels of HbA1c ≥9% were linked to a 60% increased risk of pneumonia-related complications and hospitalization due to a lower immune response.80 Host defense to infection is largely mediated by cellular immunity and the synthesis of related cytokines, such as IFN- and interleukins, is downregulated in diabetes.75,81

data The present study has several limitations. Inspection of the funnel plot (Figure 2) and the Egger’s test indicates that publication bias may have been derived from the small-study effect, i.e., the possibility of including small studies with spuriously overstated estimates while ignoring those without statistically significant effects that may have a lower possibility of being published. Furthermore, the identified reports have shown 8-fold among-studies variance in the diabetes proportion for H1N1 (0.04-0.35; Figure 3) and MERS-CoV (0.1-0.8, Figure 4) cases. These inter-study differences may have contributed to the significant heterogeneity observed in our report. Additional sources of heterogeneity may relate to the large variation among studies in the sample size (19 to 70,000 H1N1 cases and 5 to 161 MERS-CoV patients) or the ethnic diversity of the study populations particularly within the H1N1 studies (collected from 14 counties). Furthermore, heterogeneous methodologies due to different study designs may have influenced the inter-study variation. This observation may levy some limitations on the estimated contribution of diabetes to severe H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases and render our results as a guide to generate more accurate estimates for national or international intervention strategies for severe SARI conditions in diabetic subjects. Furthermore, although the prevalence of diabetes is 15% in severe H1N1 cases and 54% in MERS-CoV, it may not implicate causality and warrants further studies to identify the nature and extent of the coexistence between diabetes and each of the two respiratory infections. Another limitation is the low number of MERS-CoV cases and the narrow geographic region from which it was recruited, compared to the H1N1 cases that rendered subgroup analysis (by region) unattainable for MERS-CoV cases. This particular limitation may add more weight to the suggestion stipulating that the difference in diabetes prevalence between H1N1 and MERS-CoV can be attributable to the regional difference in spread. The small number of MERS-CoV studies highlights the need to develop international collaborations that include cases from countries other than those in the Arabian Peninsula, e.g., from Korea where a few recent cases have been emerged recently. A single study44 has examined MERS-CoV cases pooled from various countries but the findings were still limited by the small population size. The reports identified in the present study did not distinguish between the prevalence of type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes in H1N1 or MERS-CoV cases. With the exception of three studies (only in the H1N1 - but not MERS-CoV),14,17,35 all the identified reports have combined both types of diabetes despite their different characteristics, etiological factors and clinical features. Cortes Garcia et al.,14 and Koegelenberg et al.,35 have clearly stated that the diabetic cases in their H1N1 series as type 2 cases. Jimenez-Garcia et al.,17 on the other hand, compared the demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions and in-hospital case fatality risk (CFR) in the type 1 (prevalence 0.8%) and type 2 (prevalence 8.4%) diabetic patients and reported a ~2-fold higher CFR in type 2 cases than type 1.17 Given this paucity of information, it was challenging to distinguish between the two types of diabetes for their role in viral disease severity and complication.
index 15
data In conclusion, the present study provides some evidence of a greater prevalence of diabetes to MERS-CoV severity compared to H1N1. If this relationship is causal, however, the substantial proportion of diabetes in each of the two infections suggests that introducing effective strategies for diabetes prevention may reduce the severity of a significant number of SARI conditions. Specific systematic vaccination intervention strategies against SARI diseases should be also considered for patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular conditions.82 This should be viewed as a key public health strategy in preventing SARI-associated morbidity and mortality.83 During the 1957–58 pandemic and in response to substantial morbidity and mortality, the US Surgeon General recommended annual influenza vaccination for individuals with chronic debilitating disease, people aged ≥65 years and pregnant women.84 For these high-risk groups, the first recommendation of national universal seasonal influenza vaccination was established in 2010 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).85 Recently, influenza vaccination was demonstrated to be associated with preventing allcause hospitalization in infected subjects.86 However, despite numerous recommendations from several public health organizations across the world (e.g., CDC, WHO, etc.) to administer SARI vaccines (e.g., influenza) annually to diabetic patients, vaccination rate in this vulnerable sub-population remains low.87-89 The current level of vaccination falls far short of the 2010 national health objectives call for a 90% rate to all elderly people (≥65 years of age) and 60% for younger people who have risk factors (e.g., diabetes).88 The prevalence of chronic diseases is rising in middle- and low-income countries as populations age and lifestyles and diets change. Further studies are being undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of other comorbidities in H1N1 and MERS-CoV. Subsequent introduction of effective public health vaccination intervention approaches and strategies is necessary to improve the protection against SARI in subjects with chronic disorders such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular conditions.

data Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV are two closely related zoonotic coronaviruses. Both have successfully crossed the species barrier to allow animal-to-human transmission, and further to allow human-to-human transmission (Song et al. 2005; Reusken et al. 2016). The SARS outbreak in 2003 had a mortality rate of 10% (Anderson et al. 2010), and SARS-CoV was considered the most aggressive coronavirus compared to other human coronaviruses that commonly cause mild to moderate infection in their hosts (van der Hoek 2007). MERS-CoV is the cause of an ongoing outbreak of the respiratory illness MERS (de Groot et al. 2013). At the time of writing, 1791 MERS cases have been confirmed with a mortality rate of approximately 35% (World Health Organization 2016). Both MERS and SARS have higher mortality rates in elderly and immunosuppressed populations (Gralinski and Baric 2015).
index 0
data The host changes by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV suggest that other coronaviruses can potentially cross the species barrier, become zoonotic, and enable human-to-human transmission, ultimately causing high morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV exploited mechanistically different approaches to overcome the human species barrier, but these two viruses have a lot in common (Lu et al. 2015). Here, we aim to identify the vulnerable regions in the proteomes of coronaviruses that neither SARS-CoV nor MERS-CoV nor their contemporary and forthcoming relatives can proliferate without, and address how to mobilize a defense against the present and future coronaviruses by targeting these regions.
index 1
data SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are positive (+)-strand RNA viruses encoding approximately 25 protein products. The MERS-CoV proteome is primarily composed of two polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1ab; the latter is generated by a -1 ribosomal slippage frameshift. These proteins are cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs). NSPs 1–10 are products of both polyproteins, whereas NSPs 12–16 are only yielded by ORF1ab. NSP11 is unique to ORF1a (van Boheemen et al. 2012). Structural proteins envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) are elements of the physical structure that encloses the viral genome and come from distinct reading frames, unlike ORF1a and ORF1ab, which come from overlapping reading frames. Additionally, the structural proteins are the product of subgenomic mRNAs that are joined during discontinuous negative RNA strand synthesis (van Boheemen et al. 2012). Finally, NS3 protein (NS3), NS4A protein (NS4A), NS4B protein (NS4B), NS5 protein (NS5), and Orf8b protein encompass the remainder of the proteome and also arise from distinct reading frames (van Boheemen et al. 2012).
index 2
data Our approach utilizes genomic sequence data, which is readily available for viruses known to cause disease. However, because most viruses pose no major threat to their host, they pass by unnoticed leaving the majority of virus genome space uncharted. With the availability of cost-efficient genome sequencing technology, and recent developments in the field of viral metagenomics, large-scale identification of viral genome space is on the rise (Rosario and Breitbart 2011; Mokili et al. 2012). By exploring viral diversity, critical components constituting a viral genus’ fitness can be evaluated. Examples such as the common influenza virus illustrate the rapidity of viral gene mutation and in order to maintain immune protection, an annual flu vaccination is recommended. Underway efforts aim to generate broadly neutralizing vaccines whose design accounts for the genomic sequences of multiple types of influenza virus to eliminate frequent re-vaccination against the flu (Giles and Ross 2011, 2012). Development of broadly neutralizing vaccines often relies on the consensus or ancestral sequences of extant viral sequences in order to provide greater coverage for related viruses (Kesturu et al. 2006). Unfortunately, consensus sequences can be misleading, and ancestral sequence reconstruction is error-prone for quickly diverging sequences (McCloskey et al. 2014). In addition, viruses with compact genomes often express proteins with structural disorder that may undergo structural transformations. Although these transformer proteins, like VP40 in Ebola, are masters at changing their structure, and thus expanding their functional repertoire as needed for the life cycle of the virus (Bornholdt et al. 2013), flexible regions are potentially important in rewiring protein–protein interactions between the virus and its host (Le Breton et al. 2011; Ortiz et al. 2013; Gitlin et al. 2014). The flexibility trait of many viral proteins is a complicating factor in vaccine development. For instance, Dengue virus exhibits serotype-specific antibody affinity that causes antibody-dependent enhancement, an obstacle in the development of Dengue vaccines that protects against all four serotypes (Flipse and Smit 2015). To overcome the hurdle posed by structural flexibility, we propose an additional screening step in identifying potential vaccine or antiviral targets that considers the structural flexibility of the viral proteins. The Structural Genomics Initiatives increased their success rate by excluding proteins predicted to be structurally disordered (Slabinski et al. 2007). A similar approach can perhaps benefit vaccine development. Furthermore, to make this approach robust to potential mutations, minimizing loss in efficacy or resistance, the evolutionary context of sequence and structure must be considered. Thus, we suggest expanding the concept of broadly neutralizing vaccines/antivirals by increasing the diversity of viruses considered if possible. Sites conserved for sequence, structure, and with low disorder propensity among diverse virus protein homologs are very likely to be constrained from 1) changing sequence on evolutionary time scales and 2) undergoing real-time structural transitions. These sites have potential as targets for broad-specificity antivirals or vaccines because conservation makes them broad-specificity and low dynamics avoids targeting a conformational ensemble, which is not only difficult (Yu et al. 2016), but that may change as the sequence diverges (Siltberg-Liberles et al. 2011).
index 3
data A recent large-scale study of structural disorder in >2,000 viral genomes in 41 viral families found the amount of disorder in different virus families varying from 2.9% to 23.1% (Pushker et al. 2013). It was reported that Coronaviridae has very low disorder content (mean disorder 3.68%) (Pushker et al. 2013). Coronaviridae contains two subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are part the Coronavirinae subfamily, from here on referred to as coronavirus (CoV). The lack of disorder is intriguing because it may be important for rewiring interactions between viral proteins and host proteins (Ortiz et al. 2013) and providing opportunities to acquire novel functional sequence motifs (Gitlin et al. 2014). Structural disorder has also been proposed to be important for viral viability, enabling multifunctionality and vigor in response to changes in the environment (Xue et al. 2014). Given the low fraction of structural disorder reported across Coronaviridae, we set out to investigate the conservation of structural disorder and secondary structure across CoV. Sites identified as conserved for structure and lacking disorder can be considered to be vulnerable and druggable in the proteomes of coronaviruses. The structural divergence capacity of these regions is limited, leaving a wider range of the present and emergent coronaviruses susceptible to the effects of potential broadly neutralizing anti-CoV therapies targeting these sites. We will refer to these sites as target sites.

data Protein sequences were identified by individual BLAST searches with MERS-CoV (Taxonomy ID: 1335626) proteins ORF1ab (YP_009047202.1; polyprotein), S protein (YP_009047204.1), M protein (YP_009047210.1), E protein (YP_009047209.1), and N protein (YP_009047211.1) against coronaviruses. BLAST searches of the ORF1ab protein were performed, using start and end positions as detailed in the ORF1ab NCBI Reference Sequence file, against the refseq_protein database. The sequences retrieved from the BLAST output maintained the following cutoff: >30% sequence identity and >50% coverage relative to MERS-CoV sequence query. The 30% sequence identity and 50% query coverage cutoff strikes a balance between alignment quality and at least 10 sequences for most protein families. NSP1 (YP_009047202.1; 1-193), NSP2 (YP_009047202.1; 194-853), NS3 (YP_009047205.1), NS4A (YP_009047206.1), NS4B (YP_009047207.1), NS5 (YP_009047208.1), ORF8b protein (YP_009047212.1), and NSP11 (YP_009047203.1; 4378-4391) are not included in this study due to <10 BLAST hits.
index 5
data Multiple sequence alignments were constructed for the selected BLAST hits using MAFFT (Katoh et al. 2002). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MrBayes 3.2.2 with a four category gamma distribution and the mixed model for amino acid substitution (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003). Each tree ran for five million generations, with a sample frequency of 100. The final tree was constructed from the last 75% of samples, discarding the first 25% of samples as the default burnin, and using the half-compatible parameter, to avoid weakly supported nodes (i.e., with a posterior probability <0.5). All trees were midpoint rooted.
index 6
data For every protein family, the amino acid substitution rate per site in its multiple sequence alignment was calculated using empirical Bayesian estimation as implemented in Rate4Site (Mayrose et al. 2004). Substitution rates were calculated using 16 gamma categories, the JTT substitution matrix (Jones et al. 1992), and the reconstructed phylogenies. The rates were normalized per protein family with an average across all sites equal to zero and SD equal to 1. This means that sites with a rate <0 are evolving slower than average, whereas sites with a rate >0 are evolving faster than average.
index 7
data Intrinsic disorder propensity was inferred using two different predictors: IUPred (default settings; “long” option) (Dosztányi et al. 2005a, 2005b) and DISOPRED2 (Ward et al. 2004) for all proteins. For IUPred, the site-specific continuous disorder propensities for each protein were mapped onto their corresponding position in the multiple sequence alignment as raw disorder propensities and as binary states, order or disorder, using two cutoffs of 0.4 and 0.5. Disorder propensities below the cutoff were assigned order and disorder propensities at the cutoff or above were assigned disorder. For the DISOPRED2 predictions that were inferred using the nr database, the continuous disorder propensities for every site in a protein were mapped onto their corresponding position in the multiple sequence alignment as raw disorder propensities and as binary states, order or disorder, using a cutoff of 5. Consequently, for every protein family (a multiple sequence alignment and its corresponding phylogenetic tree), two continuous matrices and three binary matrices resulted: IUPred 0.4, IUPred 0.5, and DISOPRED2. An additional matrix was generated to indicate sites where the binary order and disorder assignments differ between IUPred 0.4 and DISOPRED2.
index 8
data A similar methodology was employed to analyze secondary structure predicted by PSIPRED (McGuffin et al. 2000) and JPred (Drozdetskiy et al. 2015). For both predictors, the uniref90 database was used and sites were classified as loops, alpha helices, or beta strands and mapped back onto their corresponding sites in the multiple sequence alignment. This resulted in two three-state matrices for each protein family alignment, one for each predictor, and two binary matrices displaying secondary structure elements (alpha helix and beta strand) or loops. An additional matrix was generated to indicate sites where the secondary structure assignments differ between PSIPRED and JPred.
index 9
data For every protein family, the binary matrices resulting from the different disorder predictions and from the different secondary structure predictions were analyzed in the corresponding evolutionary context using GLOOME. GLOOME (Gain-Loss Mapping Engine) analyzes binary presence and absence patterns in a phylogenetic context (Cohen et al. 2010). In this study, the Rate4Site option in GLOOME was used to analyze the binary matrices (IUPred 0.4, IUPred 0.5, DISOPRED2, PSIPRED, and JPred) with the corresponding phylogenetic trees to map change of state across sites in each individual protein phylogeny (Cohen and Pupko 2010; Cohen et al. 2010). GLOOME was run with 16 gamma categories and a substitution matrix set to equal rates within each state and transitions between states treated equally. From the binary disorder and order matrices, transition rates between disorder and order or vice versa (DOT) were estimated. From the binary structure and loop matrices, transition rates between structure and loop or vice versa (SLT) were estimated. Similar to Rate4Site, the rates were normalized per protein family with an average across all sites equal to zero and SD equal to 1. This means that sites with a rate <0 are evolving slower than average, while sites with a rate >0 are evolving faster than average.
index 10
data Protein families were visualized in an integrative manner with a phylogenetic tree, any matrix (multiple sequence alignment or predictor based) displayed as a heatmap, and site-specific sequence transition rates using Python packages ETE3 (Huerta-Cepas et al. 2016) and Matplotlib (Hunter 2007).
index 11
data Amino acid evolutionary rates (SEQ) for all sites across all alignments were aggregated and binned into four possible categories characterized by the distribution of PSIPRED predicted secondary structure at each site. Sites predicted to have a loop across all sequences are “conserved loops; C(L)” and sites predicted to have a helix across all sequences or a strand across all sequences are “conserved helix-strand; C(HS)” (table 3). Sites predicted to have all three states (helix, strand, and loop) or any combination of loop and one other state are “non-conserved helix, loop, strand; NC(HLS)” and sites predicted to have a mixture of helix and strand are “non-conserved helix-strand; NC(HS)” (table 3). In all cases, gaps were ignored when classifying combinations of secondary structure at a site or if secondary structure conservation exists at a particular site.
index 12
data Phylogenies were built for all protein products encoded in the MERS-CoV single-stranded RNA genome, except for NSP1, NSP2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, ORF8b protein, and NSP11, all of which had insufficient sequence data (<10 sequence hits with BLAST).
index 13
data NSP12 is often used as a measure for newly identified coronaviruses. According to the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses, a major criterion in determining if a coronavirus is considered novel is pairwise sequence identity below 90% for NSP12 in all comparisons to previously known coronaviruses (Bermingham et al. 2012). Four main clades, alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus (fig. 1), are identified in agreement with the taxonomic classifications described by the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2015). Coronaviruses not listed by the ICTV are assumed to be a part of the clade in which representatives with known classifications are situated in our NSP12 phylogeny.

index 14
data The MERS clade and SARS clade are sister clades in the NSP12 phylogeny. The HKU1 clade and EQU clade are also sister clades. Together these four clades form the Betacoronavirus clade, in accordance with the ICTV classification (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2015). Betacoronavirus is represented in all phylogenies although the order of the individual subclades varies. Alphacoronavirus is often found as the sister clade or outgroup to betacoronavirus. Deltacoronavirus or gammacoronavirus are the most distantly related to the betacoronavirus. In the nucleocapsid phylogeny, gammacoronavirus is the first outgroup clade to betacoronavirus, and alphacoronavirus is the most distant outgroup. Most NSP trees exhibit some unresolved nodes at junctures immediately preceding terminal nodes. As an effect of the 50% majority rule, most of the 546 resolved nodes are well supported with posterior probability >0.9 for 82% and >0.99 for 68% (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). Most trees follow the NSP12 topology for the main clades, with minor clade rearrangements. It should be noted that for NSP5, the entire alphacoronavirus clade is placed within the betacoronavirus clade, as a sister clade to the MERS clade (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). This may be due to increased sequence divergence rates or due to recombination. Recombination events are rather frequent in coronaviruses (Su et al. 2016), and the MERS clade potentially underwent multiple recombination events as part of the host change (Zhang et al. 2016).
index 15
data The phylogenies for membrane protein, spike protein, NSP5, and NSP8–NSP16 demonstrate (with the given BLAST cutoffs) recoverable protein homologs such that all coronaviruses are represented (i.e., all coronaviruses represented in the NSP12 phylogeny). Nucleocapsid, NSP4, and NSP7 have recoverable homologs in all clades except deltacoronavirus. NSP3 and NSP6 homologs are too divergent in deltacoronavirus and/or gammacoronavirus relative to MERS-CoV. Envelope appears specific to betacoronavirus (fig. 1), but it is a short protein that has been found to diverge rapidly and is likely present outside betacoronavirus (Fehr and Perlman 2015). Because different protein families yield slightly different phylogenies, for the remaining evolutionary analyses, every protein family was analyzed in the context of its own phylogeny.
index 16
data For all protein families, structural disorder propensities were predicted using IUPred (Dosztányi et al. 2005a, 2005b) and DISOPRED2 (Ward et al. 2004). To verify the robustness of the binary IUPred and DISOPRED2 predictions, the binary assignments were compared on a site-by-site basis (table 1). When converted to binary (i.e., two states per site disordered or ordered) IUPred 0.4 and IUPred 0.5 are in good agreement with the larger differences seen for NSP8, NSP9, and nucleocapsid (7.5%, 6.5%, and 19.0%, respectively) (table 1). Comparing IUPred 0.4 or IUPred 0.5 to DISOPRED2, large differences are in particular seen for nucleocapsid (38.7% and 29.7% respectively) and NSP8 (23.5% and 25.9%, respectively) (table 1). For nucleocapsid, regions that are found to be disordered by IUPred 0.4 are found to be ordered by IUPred 0.5 and DISOPRED2 (fig. 2 and supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). For NSP8, regions that are only slightly disordered in a few sequences according to IUPred 0.4 and IUPred 0.5, DISOPRED2 predicts disorder to be conserved for all sequences (fig. 3).

data To quantify the fraction of disordered sites per protein family, we report the IUPred 0.4 results only for simplicity (table 1). In general, IUPred 0.4 predicts more disorder than DISOPRED2, but several protein families have almost no disordered sites. NSP3 and NSP8-10 have some variation in disorder content for different viruses. Based on the fraction of disorder, nucleocapsid is the only highly disordered protein among the CoVs in this study, even if NSPs 8–10 have outliers that are >20% disordered.
index 18
data To compare the disorder-to-order transition rates (DOT) for all protein families where the binary matrices of disorder and order include both states, the quadrant count ratio (QCR) was estimated as a measure of association in assigning slower than average vs. faster than average transition rates. For IUPred 0.4 vs. IUPred 0.5, for IUPred 0.5 vs DISOPRED2, and for IUPred 0.4 vs. DISOPRED2, the QCRs were 0.76, 0.69, and 0.63, respectively. This shows a strong positive association for site-specific DOT for all methods and cutoffs, with IUPred 0.4 vs. IUPred 0.5 being the strongest (table 2). For nucleocapsid and NSP8, the positive associations are weaker, suggesting that many sites have IUPred disorder propensity in the 0.4 to 0.5 range and large differences between IUPred and DISOPRED2, in accordance with the large disagreement between the binary assignment of these predictors (tables 1 and 2).

index 19
data For all protein families, secondary structure elements were predicted using PSIPRED (McGuffin et al. 2000) and JPred (Drozdetskiy et al. 2015). For most protein families, the disagreement between secondary structure predictors is greater than for the disorder predictors (table 1). In fact, 15 of the 17 protein families compared disagree at more than 10% of alignment sites, and two of these disagree at more than 20% of sites. To compare the binary structure-to-loop transitions (SLT), QCR was estimated as a measure of association for SLT based on the different predictors. In general, there is a moderate positive association between SLT for PSIPRED vs. SLT for JPred that is weaker than for the different DOT comparisons (table 2). It should be noted that SLT does not differentiate between alpha helix and beta strand, but considers both as “structure.” This is a correct assumption if protein structure is conserved and consistently predicted, but for some protein families that is not the case.
index 20
data Four protein families (NSP3, NSP12, NSP13, and SPIKE) have more than 40% of their sites found within the NC(HLS) category with non-conserved helix, strand, and loop (two or three states present at the same site) (table 3). For NSP13, JPred predicts 72% of all sites to be a mixture of helix, strand, and loop, or any combination of loop and one other structural element (fig. 4). Envelope and NSP6 have 13% and 12% of their respective sites in the NC(HS) category. Considering only the PSIPRED predictions, the NC(HS) category has 245 sites across all 17 protein families. That is one-tenth the size of the next smallest set which is C(HS) with 2275 sites. Next, C(L) has 3344 sites, and the largest category is NC(HLS) with 4257 sites. Comparing the evolutionary sequence rates for the sites in the different categories, based on PSIPRED predictions only, reveals that sites in the C(HS) category are evolving at a slower rate than all other categories. NC(HS) is only just significantly different (P = 4.62E−03) from C(HS), and is not significantly different from NC(HLS) and C(L) (P = 1.85E−02 and P = 8.33E−01, respectively). However, NC(HLS) and C(L) are significantly different from each other, and both are significantly different from C(HS) (P = 1.82E−46 and P = 2.33E−21, respectively) (fig. 5).



index 21
data For regions with five or more consecutive sites that were 100% conserved in sequence across 1) all CoV or 2) across the MERS and SARS clades, the information of structural disorder prediction from IUPred and DISOPRED2 was used to identify all ungapped sites that were consistently predicted to have 100% conserved order. Next, the information of secondary structure prediction from PSIPRED and JPred was used to narrow down this list further by only including sites that are not changing their predicted secondary structure state for both predictors. Applying the aforementioned filters to the initial 10,000 sites resulted in one (1) region of five residues or more conserved across all CoV within the N-terminal domain of NSP12: DNQDL (table 4). Interestingly, this region is in the vicinity of sites found important for nucleotidylating activity across the order Nidovirales (Lehmann et al. 2015).

index 22
data Considering only the sequences in the SARS and MERS clades, 21 sequence regions of five residues or more were found in seven protein families (table 4). For NSP5, NSP7, and NSP14, experimentally determined structures show that most regions are surface accessible (fig. 6). Some of the identified target sites are known for their functional importance. For instance, C145 in the middle of GSCGS in NSP5 is part of the catalytic dyad in the NSP5 protease (Yang et al. 2003). For NSP12 and NSP13, which have the majority of all sites, no structures are available. The sites adjacent to DNQDL are also conserved in the SARS and MERS clades, and five additional target sites, conserved for the SARS and MERS clades, are found in the C-terminal direction relative to the DNQDL motif (table 4). Continuing into the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (RdRP) in NSP12, four additional regions of target sites are found, and the last three regions are found in the C-terminal part. Importantly, in RdRP and in the C-terminal part are sites that are also conserved across all CoVs in this study. NSP13 has four regions of target sites distributed across the protein.

index 23
data We have analyzed the protein evolution of the genetic components that make up the MERS-CoV proteome. As previously established, MERS-CoV has the same genomic makeup as HKU4-CoV and HKU5-CoV in the MERS clade (Woo et al. 2012). Some protein products are only found in the MERS clade, and these were excluded from this study due to insufficient data. Furthermore, for other protein products, some clades may not be represented in our protein families if their proteins were too divergent. This was an important factor in determining the applied BLAST hit cutoffs, as relaxing cutoffs produced alignments with more gaps and increasing stringency reduced the representative pool. Because alignment quality is important due to the sensitivity of both Rate4Site and for phylogenetic reconstruction, the chosen cutoffs are suitable. We note some clade-specific differences in recoverable homologs between different CoV, but many components are shared among them (fig. 1).
index 24
data Viral proteins often possess multifunctionality, mediated by a conformational change in response to environment-specific factors (Xue et al. 2014). Although conformational flexibility is important for function, it also offers flexibility in what sequence motifs are on display. If these sequences are rapidly diverging, different sequence motifs will be displayed, reinforcing the notion that flexible regions are potentially important in rewiring protein–protein interactions between virus and host (Gitlin et al. 2014). Although most CoV proteins have almost no intrinsic disorder, several CoV protein families have homologous sites that display loop in some sequences, helix in others and strands in some (table 3, supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online). These sites are not necessarily disordered but they may be conformationally flexible in real-time (with secondary structure transitions in the same sequence, making them difficult to predict) or on evolutionary time-scales (so that different secondary structure elements actually are present in different sequences). The C(HS) and C(L) sites make up approximately 50–80% of most multiple sequence alignments. With the common expectation that protein structure is more conserved than sequence these numbers are surprisingly low. Neither PSIPRED nor JPred consistently predicts the same state for 20–50% of all sites in these multiple sequence alignments.
index 25
data The accuracy of PSIPRED and JPred’s secondary structure predictions are about 80% (Bryson et al. 2005; Drozdetskiy et al. 2015). PSIPRED has been found to rarely predict an alpha helix instead of a beta strand and vice versa, and most of the PSIPRED errors are due to secondary structure not being predicted (Li et al. 2014). When secondary structure is not conserved for the same site in a multiple sequence alignment, it suggests that the secondary structure prediction may be 1) inaccurate, 2) not predicted with high confidence, or 3) the regions are indeed metamorphic; they can transition from one element to another. Although (1) is difficult to address without experimentally determined structures for all sequences, (2) and (3) are not necessarily incompatible interpretations because low confidence secondary structure prediction could indicate metamorphic secondary structure regions. Metamorphic secondary structure regions have interesting consequences for conformational and functional flexibility.
index 26
data It should be noted that, despite the low amount of disordered sites in most CoV proteins, several regions are not conserved in disorder propensity across all sequences, but sometimes the different predictors disagree as in the case of NSP8. Clade-specific disordered regions resulting from indel events suggest that they are not essential to the critical functions of the protein, but could cause gain-and-loss of interactions with its hosts. However, when disorder propensity is only mildly fading for a region that is present across the protein family, it may be important for the fundamental function of the protein. The virus structural proteins that interact to form the virion commonly include an envelope protein, a membrane protein, and a capsid protein that together form the machinery that encases, transports, and releases the virus. The interactions between the structural proteins are often regulated by conformational changes like VP40 in Ebola (Bornholdt et al. 2013) and Envelope protein from Dengue virus (Zheng et al. 2014). Conformational changes in these proteins are needed for the virus life cycle. For CoVs, nucleocapsid is the only structural protein that is highly disordered. Yet, rapid evolutionary dynamics of disorder is present in nucleocapsid using two different IUPred cutoffs (0.4 and 0.5) and with DISOPRED2. Even if the different predictors and cutoffs disagree somewhat where regions with rapid evolutionary dynamics are present, these patterns suggest that nucleocapsid may be rapidly changing from one virus to another. It should also be noted that two MERS clade specific inserts around position 241 and toward the C-terminal are consistently predicted to be highly disordered. With inserts and changing structural dynamics between clades or viruses, the questions become 1) which sequence motif are displayed and 2) to what extent are these sequence motifs displayed?
index 27
data Furthermore, based on the inconsistent prediction of secondary structure elements, the possibility that CoVs are more conformationally flexible than their intrinsic disorder content implies is noteworthy. Altogether, this suggests that various mechanisms for rewiring conformational and functional space are operating in the coronaviruses studied here. If regions symptomatic of conformational and functional flexibility can be avoided in order to identify broad-specificity antiviral targets with potential to be effective against coronaviruses of today and in the future, coronaviruses as a group may become more attractive drug targets for the pharmaceutical industry in the event an additional coronavirus changes host to include humans or increase its virulence.

data Several fatal infectious diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), Ebola and Zika virus, have recently emerged around the world, and mortality rates are very high in patients who contract these illnesses (1). Many infectious diseases are caused by viral infections, and in particular by RNA viruses. Detection and identification of these viruses are essential for understanding viral disease, and the accuracy and availability of tools designed for this purpose are crucial for effective and efficient virological studies.
index 0
data The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used for rapid virus identification due to its low cost and high sensitivity and specificity, as well as the ubiquitous availability of the necessary reagents and equipment. Design of high-quality primers is essential for reliable PCR-based virus detection. During the design process, it is necessary to simultaneously check multiple filtering constraints on primers and perform similarity testing to verify that the designed primers will amplify only target virus rather than off-target sequences. Similarity testing for virus detection is a non-trivial task because, to achieve reliable detection, it is necessary to consider not only the entire genome of the host, but also the genomes of all other viruses, as off-target sequences.
index 1
data Very few online database resources have compiled high-quality PCR primers for RNA viruses. Most primer databases, including PrimerBank (2,3), RTPrimerDB (4–6) and qPrimerDepot (7), contain primers for general use in real-time PCR and qPCR in specific organisms such as human, mouse, rat, fruit fly and zebrafish but do not contain primers for virus detection. The NCBI Probe Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/probe/) provides nucleic acid reagents for use in a wide variety of biomedical research applications such as RNAi, PCR and microarray, as well as primers and probes for the detection of some viruses. However, its primers and probes are designed under various different filtering constraints and not validated against other viruses. Thus, they might not be appropriate for use in qPCR experiments requiring a full set of primer pairs that satisfy the same constraints, or in experiments requiring no cross-reactivity with different viruses. VirOligo (8), a database for virus-specific oligonucleotides, initially compiled from the published literature more than 1637 oligonucleotides for detection of bovine respiratory disease-associated viruses. The last updated version of VirOligo (http://viroligo.okstate.edu/index.html) supports 109 RNA/DNA viruses. However, the database has not been updated with new entries for a number of years (the last update was in 2003). Primer-BLAST (9), one of the most widely used web-based tools for primer design, performs target-specific similarity testing. However, it is not suitable for designing PCR primers for RNA viruses, primarily for two reasons. First, it can perform similarity testing only within the same species. That is, it cannot perform similarity testing of a candidate primer designed to detect a specific virus in human that is related to two different species. For the same reason, it cannot design a primer to detect specific virus(es) in a host infected by multiple viruses. Second, it does not support batch design of primers for multiple segments of a virus, which is essential to ensure accurate detection in multi-phase PCR experiments. Accordingly, this lack of public resources prevents efficient detection of viruses in hosts, representing an obstacle to a more comprehensive understanding of viral disease.
index 2
data To effectively detect and identify RNA viruses, we present a new database, MRPrimerV, which contains a collection of 152 380 247 high-quality PCR primer pairs for detection of 1818 RNA viruses. These in silico primers can detect 100% of RNA viruses in the most up-to-date version of the NCBI RefSeq database (Release 76, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/). The database contains at least one valid primer pair for each of the 7144 coding sequences (CDSs) of these viruses. All primer pairs satisfy the same stringent filtering constraints and have passed rigorous similarity testing against all 101 684 human gene sequences and all RNA virus sequences in the RefSeq database. As a result, every primer pair in MRPrimerV is highly specific for RNA viruses. If a target virus has multiple CDSs, then MRPrimerV ranks the CDSs by the penalty scores of their best primer pairs: the lower the score, the higher the quality of the primer pair. We also consider a primer pair that can detect more number of genome neighbors as a higher quality one. To detect a target RNA virus, users need only pick and use the first primer pair for a single-phase PCR experiment, or the first two primer pairs for two-phase PCR experiments. In addition, we extracted 44 653 genome neighbors from the NCBI Viral Genome Resource, analyzed them along with RefSeq sequences, and compiled the result into the MRPrimerV database. Consequently, MRPrimerV provides the list of genome neighbors that can be detected using each primer pair, covering a total of 22 192 variants of 532 RefSeq RNA viruses.
index 3
data A schematic overview of MRPrimerV is provided in Figure 1. In the interest of thoroughness, we used the entire set of RNA virus sequences in the most up-to-date RefSeq database that have at least one CDS. The total number of such viruses is 1818; the total number of non-segmented genomes is 1400; and the total number of segmented genomes is 418. The 418 segmented genomes have many segments, and the total number of segments is 1572. Some viral genomes or segments have many CDSs, and the total number of CDSs in 1818 viruses is 7144. We used all 7144 CDSs as one of the source databases for MRPrimerV. In addition to viral sequences, primer design for virus detection requires a set of human sequences for similarity testing. To compile high-quality PCR primers, we used all 101 684 human gene sequences in the RefSeq database as another source database for MRPrimerV. We also used the gene sequences of other animal species to detect some viruses. Concerning the MERS-CoV virus involved in recent outbreaks of respiratory illness, we used 26 720 camel (Camelus dromedarius) sequences in the RefSeq database as another source of sequences for MRPrimerV. The RefSeq database provides a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant, well-annotated set of sequences and reference standards for multiple purposes, including genome annotation, gene identification and comparative analyses (10). However, the RefSeq database generally contains one genome per viral species; therefore, other sequence variants and closely related groups of viruses may not be detected using primers designed based on a single reference genome (11). For example, it may be difficult to use primers designed based on the reference HIV-1 sequence to detect the many subtypes of HIV-1. To overcome the limitations of the RefSeq database, we extracted 44 653 genome sequences from the NCBI Viral Genome Resource (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/). These sequences were collected by the NCBI Viral Genomes Project as validated genomes for viral species and indexed as ‘neighbors’ to reflect well-defined genotypes (12). We performed sequence alignments between the primers designed based on the RefSeq sequences and the genome neighbor sequences, and then inserted information regarding which neighbors can be detected using each primer pair into the MRPrimerV database.
index 4
data To obtain all feasible and valid primers for RNA virus detection, we applied multiple filtering constraints and performed large-scale rigorous similarity testing against all human gene sequences using the MRPrimer technology (13), which returns all feasible and valid primer pairs existing in RNA virus sequences. MRPrimer performs fairly complex, large-scale processing to simultaneously check filtering constraints and perform similarity testing of all possible sub-sequences in a given database, based on a distributed MapReduce framework, resulting in design of very high-quality primers. qPCR analysis using many primer pairs, along with the corresponding sequencing and comparative analyses, revealed that primer pairs designed by MRPrimer are stable and effective in qPCR experiments (13). For qPCR experiments as well as for single or simultaneous multiple specific RNA virus detection, we applied the same filtering constraints to all primer pairs for all RNA viruses (Table 1). MRPrimerV includes not only SYBR Green primers, but also TaqMan probes to facilitate more reliable detection of viruses. The filtering constraints for TaqMan probe design are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
index 5
data We converted the results of MRPrimer processing, along with an annotation database downloaded from GenBank (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/), to the MRPrimerV database in key–value format. The resultant database contains 152 380 247 in silico primer pairs for detection of 2963 non-segmented genomes or segments. Table 2 shows the statistics of RNA viruses covered by the primer pairs in MRPrimerV. In Table 2, ‘CDS-specific primers’ indicates primers that can amplify only a specific CDS of a target virus, i.e. they are target-specific in terms of CDS. By contrast, ‘virus-specific primers’ are those that amplify multiple CDSs of a target virus, but do not amplify CDSs of other viruses, i.e. they are target-specific in terms of virus. Amplicon size using a CDS-specific primer is unique, whereas that using a virus-specific primer might not be unique. MRPrimerV contains not only CDS-specific primers, but also virus-specific primers, because the latter are still target-specific for detection of a specific virus. Moreover, we note that, if valid primers exist for some segments of a virus with a segmented genome, we can detect that virus using those primers even when there are no valid primers for the remaining segments. Under the default constraints in Table 1, use of both CDS- and virus-specific primers could improve the RNA virus coverage ratio from 99.1% to 99.4% (Table 2). To further improve the coverage ratio, we relaxed the filtering constraints (Relaxed in Table 1) and performed MRPrimer processing. As a result, in terms of viral non-segmented genomes or segments, the coverage ratio was improved up to 99.7% (Table 2). All 1818 RNA viruses were completely covered, i.e. they could be detected using MRPrimerV compiled under relaxed constraints.
index 6
data We validated the primers in MRPrimerV with viral genome neighbor sequences from the NCBI Viral Genome Resource. The 44 653 genome neighbors we used cover a total of 532 RefSeq RNA sequences for viruses infecting human hosts. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the number of RefSeq sequences for each range of numbers of genome neighbors. The majority of RefSeq sequences (379/532, 71.24%) have fewer than 10 genome neighbors, and only 0.03% of RefSeq sequences have more than 1000 genome neighbors. For instance, Human rotavirus B strain Bang373 (NC_021541) has four neighbors, whereas Rotavirus A segment 8 (NC_011502) has 2318 neighbors. We aligned the top-50 primers designed under the default constraints (Table 1) with the genome neighbor sequences and checked whether each primer pair can amplify each genome neighbor. Table 3 shows the statistics of genome neighbors covered by the top-50 primers in MRPrimerV. The top-50 primers cover 22 192 neighbors out of 44 653 neighbors (49.69%). In the case of HIV-1, the top-50 primers cover 99.83% of neighbors and the top-50 primers for Rotavirus C segment 5 (NC_007570) cover 72.47% of neighbors.
index 7
data The MRPrimerV database consists of nine key–value tables: one table for PCR primers, one table for TaqMan probes, five partial annotation tables for five query types, one full annotation table for viral genomes, and one full annotation table for viral CDSs. The partial annotation tables are used to identify user input for each query type. The full annotation tables are used to generate the output page. The database is physically stored using Redis (http://redis.io/), an in-memory key–value store that supports various kinds of data structures for various types of values, including string, hash, list, set and sorted set.
index 8
data Due to a very large number of off-target sequences, including the 101 684 human gene sequences used to perform similarity testing, we had to run MRPrimer on a DGIST supercomputer (Rank #454 in TOP500 Supercomputer, June 2016) for more than 2 weeks to both check multiple filtering constraints and perform large-scale rigorous similarity testing for billions of candidate primers and probes. At present, it is important to perform large-scale processing to obtain high-quality products. For instance, DeepBind (15) performs large-scale deep learning to generate a database of predictive models of the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins.
index 9
data MRPrimerV provides two kinds of interfaces, simple search and glossary, which users can employ to search for primer pairs for a target RNA virus. In the simple search interface, users input a target RNA virus (as organism, keywords, GenBank accession, NCBI gene symbol or NCBI Gene ID) and click the search button. MRPrimerV then immediately outputs the best primer pairs for each CDS of the target RNA virus. Especially, in the simple search interface for ‘organism,’ MRPrimerV supports the query autocomplete feature, so that users can conveniently type the name of their organism of interest in the search box. On the glossary page, lists of RNA viruses are sorted alphabetically, so users can easily browse RNA viruses and obtain the primer pairs for a specific virus by clicking its name. The output page of both interfaces provides a brief description for the virus, a GenBank accession number with a link to the corresponding GenBank web page, brief information regarding the CDS (e.g. gene symbol and gene ID), and detailed information about the top primer pair including the penalty score, forward and backward primer sequences, TaqMan probe, melting temperatures, amplicon size, primer positions and validation results. In addition, MRPrimerV provides brief information and the list of genome neighbors that can be detected using the corresponding primer pair if information if available. Figure 3 shows primer pairs for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and mumps virus with the list of 78 genome neighbors for gene symbol L. Although the MRPrimerV database contains 152 380 247 primer pairs, the output web page interface does not show all primer pairs in the results, since it might be inconvenient for users. Users can adjust the number of resultant primer pairs for each CDS among Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 and Top-50 by clicking the dropdown menu in the output web page.
index 10
data If the target virus has multiple CDSs, then MRPrimerV ranks the CDSs by the penalty scores of their best primer pairs: the lower the score, the higher the quality of the primer pair. We also consider a primer pair that can detect more number of genome neighbors as a higher quality one. The penalty score is calculated according to the method used in Primer3Plus (16). Thus, PCR using the best primer pair of the best (i.e. lowest-scoring) CDS is potentially more sensitive than PCR using the best primer pair from the next-best (i.e. second-lowest-scoring) CDS. In Figure 3, RSV has 10 CDSs; the output page first shows the top primer pair (penalty score: 5.027) for gene symbol G, and, next, the top primer pair (penalty score: 5.483) for gene symbol NS1. In most cases, to detect a target RNA virus, users need only pick and use the first primer pair for a single-phase PCR experiment.
index 11
data In some cases, users might want to perform multi-phase PCR experiments for more accurate detection of viruses. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that three rRT-PCR assays be conducted for routine detection of MERS (17). Because MRPrimerV ranks the CDSs and their top primer pairs by their penalty scores, users can easily select primers for multi-phase PCR experiments. For instance, for two-phase PCR experiments, users need only pick and use the first two primer pairs.
index 12
data MRPrimerV also supports detection of specific virus(es) for a host infected by multiple viruses because all primer pairs in MRPrimerV were rigorously similarity-tested against not only the human sequence database, but also the entire RNA virus sequence database; at the same time, they all satisfy the same stringent and uniform filtering constraints. For instance, when we performed validation using Influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, each of which has seven segments and seven corresponding top primer pairs, we observed no cross-reactivity. The primers for H1N1 yielded a single band only for H1N1, but no band for H3N2, and vice versa. We also performed validation using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Dengue virus (Flavivirus). We observed no cross-reactivity; the JEV primers yielded only a single band for JEV and no band for Dengue virus. Sequencing analysis also confirmed the absence of cross-reactivity.
index 13
data MRPrimerV contains not only primers and probes, but also validation results for some viruses, in particular 12 RNA viruses from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of Korea (http://www.cdc.go.kr/CDC/eng/main.jsp). These viruses represent the entire set of viruses maintained by the CDC of Korea (Supplementary Table S2). By clicking the ‘validation results’ button, users can view validation data including specimen information, agarose gel data, qPCR amplification and melting curves, and sequencing data of the qPCR amplicon obtained using the selected primer pair. The right popup window in Figure 3 shows validation results for RSV.
index 14
data The recent MERS outbreak in Korea, which spread rapidly due to slow and unreliable diagnosis, resulted in a 41% reduction in foreign tourism and decreased the gross domestic product growth rate in 2015 by 0.1% (18). The MRPrimerV database contains 152 380 247 high-quality PCR primer pairs for detection of 1818 viruses, covering 100% of the RNA viruses in the most up-to-date NCBI RefSeq database (Release 76). Because all primers in MRPrimerV were subjected to the same stringent filtering constraints and rigorous similarity testing against all 101 684 human gene sequences, 26 720 camel sequences and all RNA virus sequences, they are all highly target-specific for RNA viruses. The current MRPrimerV database mainly provides primers for detection of RNA viruses that infect human hosts. However, since many human pathogens, such as Zika, JEV, WNV, DENV, MERS-CoV and influenza virus, can also infect other animal species, future work will be directed toward updating the database to include primers against other animal species. MRPrimerV is freely accessible and provides a user-friendly interface. Because the database ranks the CDSs by the penalty scores of their best primer pairs, users can easily select primers for multi-phase PCR experiments to achieve more accurate detection of viruses. MRPrimerV also supports multi-virus detection and TaqMan probes. MRPrimerV contains not only primers, but also validation results for some viruses, and users are invited to send their own experimental validation data for MRPrimerV primers, so that they can be shared by researchers and international health communities. In addition, MRPrimerV provides the list of genome neighbors that can be detected using each primer pair, covering a total of 22 192 variants of 532 RefSeq RNA viruses. Therefore, this database could be used in viral metagenomics studies aimed at evaluating viral variability, as well as other scientific tasks. In the future, we will add a feature that allows users to design primers using virus sequences they provide. We believe that MRPrimerV, as a public database of high-quality primers for RNA virus detection, will aid future efforts to design primers for reliable diagnoses, facilitating effective responses to potential epidemics.

data Hantaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the family of Bunyaviridiae. In humans, they give rise to a spectrum of illnesses called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. HCPS carries a mortality rate of 40%, whereas the mortality in HFRS is lower (0.4%–15%), but the incidence of HFRS is substantially higher. Classically, HFRS occurs in 5 distinct phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, polyuric, and convalescent. Capillary leakage, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury (AKI) are the key elements in the pathogenesis of HFRS. Specific treatment is not available for hantavirus infection.[1]
index 0
data Low platelet count is a hallmark of hantavirus disease, but the severity of bleeding symptoms varies according to the hantavirus species. Signs of bleeding can be noted in up to one-third of the patients infected with the most common European hantavirus, Puumala virus (PUUV). Hemorrhage has been documented in various organs in fatal cases,[2] and mild mucocutaneous involvement has been reported in general. However, thromboembolic complications and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke have been reported to associate with PUUV-induced HFRS in Swedish patients.[3,4] The individual balance between enhanced and hampered coagulation prevails and remains challenging.

data Recent studies support the idea of platelet contribution to disease progression and binding to fibrin-covered endothelial cells as a mechanism leading to the decreased platelet count during acute hantavirus infection.[1] Upregulated tissue factor (TF) expression on the infected endothelial cells is suggested to induce increased thrombin formation noted during PUUV infection.[5,6] Compatibly with endothelial cell activation, elevated level of tissue plasminogen activator and d-dimer have both been observed.[6,7] Findings of enhanced platelet ligands are in concordance with those of increased platelet activation.[8,9] Large mean platelet volume (MPV) and immature platelet fraction % (IPF%) together with elevated serum thrombopoietin (TPO) level imply active thrombopoiesis.[9,10] Despite increased platelet production the aggregation is, however, impaired.[10]
index 2
data We here studied serum TPO level and the procoagulant activity of plasma microparticles (MPs) in 33 Finnish patients who were treated in hospital for acute PUUV infection. We analyzed the results in relation with clinical data, platelet function tests in whole blood (platelet function analyzer PFA-100 and Multiplate), and coagulation variables available. Our aim was to study whether active thrombopoiesis could be confirmed during the thrombocytopenia associated with acute hantavirus infection. We also sought to further characterize the procoagulant changes observed in vitro and in vivo. As the prediction of disease severity is still of utmost importance in the treatment of hantavirus infection, we particularly compared the relationship of our findings with the clinical disease severity.
index 3
data The study was carried out at Tampere University Hospital and University of Tampere School of Medicine, Finland. All patients came from Pirkanmaa region and were hospitalized because of serologically confirmed [11]acute PUUV infection during the period from October 2010 to November 2015. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the Ethics Committee of Tampere University Hospital approved the study protocol.
index 4
data The study group consisted of 33 prospectively collected consecutive adult patients (22 males), median age 45 years (range 21–67 years). Twenty-nine of the patients also participated in a previous study determining platelet indices and functions during acute PUUV infection.[10] Concomitant diseases included arterial hypertension (n = 5), diabetes mellitus (n = 3), hypercholesterolemia (n = 2), coronary heart disease (n = 2), sleep apnea (n = 2), and celiac disease (n = 2). One patient had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 1 patient had undergone splenectomy because of hereditary spherocytosis. No patient was under immunosuppression or anticoagulation. Two patients received anti-platelet therapy (acetylsalicylic acid, 100 mg daily).
index 5
data The following variables were recorded: smoking (yes/no), the number of days from the onset of fever up to the acute phase sample collection, the lowest diastolic and systolic blood pressure (mmHg), clinical diagnosis of shock (yes/no), signs of bleeds (yes/no), thromboembolic complications (yes/no), infusion of platelets (yes/no), need for transient hemodialysis treatment (yes/no), maximum and minimum daily urinary output (mL), and gain in weight (kg). The last variable reflects fluid retention during the hospital stay in the oliguric phase of the disease. Complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured in plasma samples according to clinical need. The laboratory analyses were carried out at the Laboratory Centre of Pirkanmaa Hospital District using standard methods.
index 6
data Serum samples to measure TPO level in the acute phase of the disease were collected median 8 days (range 2–13 days) from the beginning of fever. Citrated plasma for the measurement of procoagulant activity of MPs and coagulation variables (plasma fibrinogen, prothrombin fragments F1 + 2, and d-dimer) as well as whole blood for platelet indices (MPV and IPF%) and functions (PFA-100 and Multiplate) were all collected at the same time, median 7 days (range 1–12 days) from the beginning of fever. The control samples were obtained at the recovery visit, median 43 days (range 31–60 days) from the beginning of fever.
index 7
data For TPO, blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 1700g for 15 minutes, and the serum was frozen at −700C. Human Thrombopoietin Immunoassay Quantikine ELISA was applied according the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). In healthy volunteers (n = 38), the mean level of serum TPO is 74.2 pg/mL (ranging from nondetectable to 228 pg/mL), according to the manufacturer. To measure procoagulant activity of MPs in plasma, citrate-anticoagulated (109 nmol/L sodium citrate) blood samples were centrifuged at 2000g for 15 minutes. Plasma was then separated, further centrifuged at 13,000g for 2 minutes, and frozen at −700C. Blood sampling and processing of plasma were in accordance with the instructions of ZYMYPHEN MP-Activity ELISA (ANIARA, HYPHEN BioMed, West Chester, OH) that was applied for analyses. The MP- Activity test kit is a functional assay measuring procoagulant activity of MPs derived from various cellular sources.[12] In the assay, circulating MPs in the plasma sample bind to Annexin V on the microplate surface and expose their phospholipid surface, which allows prothrombin activation by factor Xa and Va complex in the presence of calcium. The exposed phospholipid concentration reflects the amount of thrombin generation, which is measured using specific thrombin substrate. According the manufacturer, concentration of MPs in normal plasma is usually ≤5 nmol/L (expressed as phophatidylserine equivalent).
index 8
data Measurement of MPV and IPF% as well as the assessment of platelet functions with PFA-100 and Multiplate is described in detail in our recent article.[10]
index 9
data Fibrinogen was measured with a modification of the Clauss method (Multifibren U, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics), d-dimer with an immunoturbidimetric assay (Tina-quant D-Dimer, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and F1 + 2 with an enzyme immunoassay (Enzygnost F1 + 2, monoclonal, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). The reference values were 1.7 to 4.0 g/L for fibrinogen, ≤0.5 mg/L for d-dimer, and 69 to 229 pmol/L for F1 + 2.
index 10
data Since all continuous variables were skewed, medians and ranges were calculated to describe the data. Numbers and percentages were used for categorical variables. Comparisons between the groups were based on Mann–Whitney U test or Kruskal–Wallis test. To evaluate changes between the acute and the recovery phase, Wilcoxon test was used. Relationships between the continuous variables were examined using Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The limit of significance was set at 0.05 (2-tailed). IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for computation.
index 11
data All 33 patients suffered from clinically typical and serologically confirmed[11] PUUV infection and were examined and hospitalized in the acute phase of the illness. All patients recovered. Table 1 presents the clinical and basic laboratory findings of the study patients. Eighteen (55%) of the patients were smokers. Ten (30%) of the patients had signs of bleeding tendency, mostly mild mucosal bleeds. No thromboembolic complications were observed by the time of control (recovery phase) visit. Three patients received platelet transfusions. Four (12%) of the patients were in clinical shock at the time of admission (ie, systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg together with clinical symptoms or signs of shock). Two patients needed transient hemodialysis, one of them and another patient were treated in the intensive care unit.
index 12
data At the time of the acute phase TPO and MP samples, 14 (45%) patients had their platelet count ≤100 × 109 cells/L (median 118 × 109 cells/L, range 17–321 × 109 cells/L). At the same time-point, the median creatinine value of the patients was 167 μmol/L (range 68–983 μmol/L). In the control (recovery phase) sample, the platelet count of all patients had recovered and in all patients exceeded the lower limit of reference range 150 × 109 cells/L (median 248 × 109/L, range 197–507 × 109 cells/L).
index 13
data Serum TPO level was nearly 4-fold higher acutely compared with the control (Table 2). The finding of elevated serum TPO level in the acute phase of the disease remained when patients were divided into 2 groups (below or above the median value) based on the platelet count at the time of TPO measurement and the lowest platelet count (Fig. 1). Large MPV and IPF% coincided with elevated serum TPO level (Table 2), and an association was noted between serum TPO level and IPF% (r = .44, P = .03).
index 14
data High serum TPO level coinciding still with thrombocytopenia associated with impaired platelet functions studied in whole blood by both PFA-100 (Fig. 2) and Multiplate in the acute phase of the disease. However, closure times studied with PFA-100 were only slightly prolonged acutely compared with the control despite the lowered platelet count (Table 2). Platelet functions studied with Multiplate are described in detail elsewhere.[10] High serum TPO associated with impaired aggregation triggered with all 5 agonists (for adrenalin, r = −0.69, P < 0.001; for adenosine diphosphate, r = −0.77, P < 0.001; for arachidonic acid, r = −0.67, P = 0.001; for collagen, r = −0.63, P = .002; for thrombin receptor-activating peptide, r = −0.50, P = .03; for ristocetin, r = −0.73, P < 0.001).
index 15
data Serum TPO level associated with the length of hospital stay (r = 0.40, P = 0.04). A negative association prevailed between TPO and minimum hematocrit (r = −0.45, P = 0.02), platelet count at the time of TPO measurement (r = −0.71, P < 0.001), and minimum platelet count (r = −0.67, P < 0.001). Signs of bleeding tendency did not, however, associate with serum TPO level. No association was found between serum acute-phase TPO level and plasma creatinine, minimum or maximum daily urinary output, gain of weight, or need of transient hemodialysis. Minimum systolic or diastolic blood pressure and smoking did not associate with serum TPO level either (data not shown).
index 16
data d-dimer was 7-fold higher acutely compared with the value measured at control visit in this group of PUUV-infected patients. F1 + 2 was clearly elevated (Table 2) and it associated with serum TPO level (r = 0.47, P = 0.03). Both d-dimer and F1 + 2 associated with minimum platelet count (r = −0.48, P = 0.01 and r = −0.46, P = 0.02, respectively), plasma creatinine level at the time of the measurement (r = 0.57, P = 0.002 and r = 0.50, P = 0.008, respectively) and maximum plasma creatinine (r = 0.54, P = 0.004 and r = 0.42, P = 0.03, respectively).
index 17
data There was no difference in the activity of MPs derived from various cellular origins in the acute phase of PUUV infection compared with the recovery phase. No associations between MPs and clinical or laboratory variables determined in this study could be observed. However, in patients with plasma creatinine value below the median of 167 μmol/L, MPs’ procoagulant activity was increased acutely compared with the control (median 2.7 nmol/L, range 0.9–5.3 nmol/L vs. median 1.8 nmol/L, range 0.8–3.2 nmol/L, P = 0.04). Likewise, MPs’ activity was increased acutely among patients with maximum plasma creatinine value below the median of 296 μmol/L (median 2.6 nmol/L, range 1.0–5.3 nmol/L vs. median 1.8 nmol/L, range 0.8–3.2 nmol/L, P = 0.03). MPs’ activity in the acute phase of the disease did not differ from the activity observed at the recovery when patients were divided into 2 groups (below or above median value) based on the platelet count at the time of the MPs’ activity measurement or the lowest platelet count.
index 18
data Two patients were severely ill and laboratory findings of them are described in Table 3. Patient 1 was a 61-year-old previously smoking male who needed intensive care treatment, and patient 2 was a 28-year-old smoking male with a need of temporary hemodialysis treatment. Both patients had a very low platelet count minimum, high acute TPO and IPF%, and prolonged closure times measured with PFA-100.
index 19
data The most evident finding of our study was the 4-fold elevated level of serum TPO during acute PUUV infection compared with the recovery phase. Elevated platelet indices MPV and IPF% imply that bone marrow response to the TPO stimulus is adequate, and decreased platelet count observed during the acute phase of the disease is contributed by factors other than impaired platelet production. The association of high TPO with decreased platelet functions measured both with PFA-100 and Multiplate was observed during thrombocytopenia. It suggests that active thrombopoiesis, though able to provide with clinical hemostasis, is not sufficient to overcome the diminished functional capacity noted in vitro. TPO did not associate with AKI, the major outcome of HFRS. The markedly increased F1 + 2 and d-dimer further support the idea of platelet consumption in the vasculature by ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis. Their association with variables reflecting AKI is a novel finding in Finnish PUUV-patients, but in line with a previous observation of high d-dimer under severe disease condition in Swedish patients.[3] We could not detect any increase in MPs’ procoagulant activity during acute PUUV infection. That finding, however, needs to be explored in more detail, but MPs have been shown to bind to fibrin surfaces,[13] which may be the case during the hantavirus infection.
index 20
data TPO is a humoral growth factor characterized for its ability to stimulate the production and differentiation of megakaryocytes. TPO is mainly produced in the liver and kidneys, and binding of TPO with its receptor c-mPl on platelet surface initiates intracellular signaling including activation of JAK2/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway. Plasma TPO concentrations vary usually inversely with the platelet count, but mechanisms other than platelet count that affect TPO have also been identified.[14]
index 21
data High plasma concentration of TPO and low platelet count have been reported in patients with Puumala hantavirus, dengue virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.[9,15,16] In HIV-infected patients, c-mPl expression per platelet is elevated, and recombinant human megakaryocytic growth factor reduces the c-mPl expression and restores platelet count to normal level.[16] In a macaque model of HIV, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) downregulates TPO, and combined antiretroviral therapy corrects both plasma TGFβ level and platelet count.[17] In severe acute respiratory syndrome induced by a novel coronavirus, TGFβ inhibits the effect of high TPO on megakaryocytopoiesis.[18] Inflammatory mediator interleukin 6 (IL-6), however, increases TPO production both in vitro and in vivo.[14] Our finding of high TPO during acute PUUV infection is in line with a previous observation [9] and consistent with both low platelet count and high plasma IL-6 in acute PUUV infection .[19] High plasma level of TPO is suggested to predict sepsis severity in the early disease phase.[20] We now noted an association between plasma level of TPO and the length of hospital stay, the latter variable describing overall disease severity. However, in this study, TPO had no association with any of the variables reflecting AKI that is the major clinical determinant of hantavirus-induced HFRS.
index 22
data The inverse association between serum TPO level and platelet functions measured by both PFA-100 and Multiplate was clear, as was the positive association between TPO and IPF%. TPO has been reported to enhance platelet activation during burn injury [21] and increase platelet adhesion under flow.[22] Moreover, high TPO has a priming effect on platelet aggregation in response to different agonists.[23] In this study, the effect of low platelet count on platelet aggregation was not compensated by the simultaneously occurring elevated TPO level and high proportion of young platelets. As major bleeding problems were avoided and no thromboembolic complications were noted, hemostasis appears clinically balanced in spite of laboratory findings reflecting impairment of primary hemostasis.
index 23
data MPs and exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are released from different cell types by exocytic budding in response to cellular activation or apoptosis. They are now seen as mediators of cell-to-cell communication.[24] They express phospholipids and are classically thought to function as procoagulants supporting thrombin formation and facilitating coagulation by factor VII/TF-dependent and -independent pathways. Elevated concentrations of MPs deriving from platelets, endothelial cells, and monocytes have been reported in arterial and venous thrombotic diseases as well as in autoimmune conditions, infectious diseases, hematologic disorders, and cancer. However, the clinical significance of these findings remains controversial.[25,26] Flow cytometry is the most widely used method to study MPs.[27]
index 24
data Increased TF expression ,[5] enhanced thrombin formation,[6] and signs of cellular activation and apoptosis[1] are all present during acute hantavirus infection, and we presumed to detect higher level of MPs’ procoagulant activity during the acute phase of the disease compared with the recovery phase. That was, however, the finding only among patients with mild kidney injury. In this study, increased thrombin formation (F1 + 2) and fibrinolysis (d-dimer) associated with the severity of AKI, and the attachment of platelet-derived MPs to fibrin clots especially in patients with more severe kidney injury could plausibly explain our observation.[13,28] Preanalytical measures as well as analytical methods in the detection of MPs’ activity are crucial[29] and even if the instructions of the ELISA-assay manufacturer were vigorously followed, the issues regarding methodology cannot be completely excluded.[12] The sample size of the study was, though not large but probably sufficient, as the difference of serum TPO level in the acute phase of the disease compared with the recovery could be verified. MPs’ procoagulant activity did not associate with any of the variables depicting disease severity, and it failed to predict clinical outcome in this group of patients with acute Puumala hantavirus infection.
index 25
data Plasma level of TPO or MPs’ activity could not predict severe hantavirus disease in the 33 patients of this study, but the 2 severely ill patients had particularly high TPO level and percentage of young platelets as well as very clearly impaired platelet functions according to PFA-100 in the acute phase of the disease (Table 3). The finding regarding MPs’ activity on these 2 individual patients was inconsistent and may stem from patients medical history, current treatment as well as the condition itself.
index 26
data In conclusion, serum TPO is upregulated and the production of platelets is enhanced during acute Puumala hantavirus disease. Serum TPO does not predict disease severity in terms of AKI. Biomarkers of thrombin generation and especially fibrinolysis are high in the absence of clinical thrombosis or major bleedings, and they associate with adverse kidney outcome. As thrombopoiesis is active and the proportion of young platelets is high, measuring the activity of platelet-derived MPs with flow cytometry might clarify the role of MPs in the pathogenesis of HFRS.

data Aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase are the common indicators used for assessing the state (or condition) of the liver. In particular, increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) indicate acute hepatocellular injury, such as viral infection, toxic injury, hypoxia, and hypoperfusion, where ALT and AST levels can rise by thousands of times the levels in the normal range. While ALT is relatively liver specific, AST levels can increase because of damage to other organs [1]. In addition, there are cases where non-hepatic respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infections lead to increased levels of ALT and AST without hepatic failure, and such conditions are referred to as nonspecific reactive hepatitis [23].
index 0
data Acute lower respiratory tract infection, a common cause of nonspecific reactive hepatitis, is an important disease that accounts for about 30% of all diseases for which pediatric patients are hospitalized, and more than 60% of the infections are caused by a virus [456]. The recent introduction of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based diagnosis of viruses has improved the detection of causative viruses, and has been conducive to vigorous research in identifying varying clinical presentations in accordance with the types of respiratory virus [7].
index 1
data In this context, the authors of this study sought to examine the relationship between the clinical manifestations of nonspecific reactive hepatitis and respiratory virus infection in pediatric patients.
index 2
data Patients who were admitted to the pediatric unit of Konyang University Hospital for lower respiratory tract disease and those who underwent an RT-PCR test between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014 were enrolled in the study. Patients who had a past history of hepatobiliary disease, and obese patients were excluded from the study [8]. Obesity was defined as a body mass index exceeding 95 percentiles at a minimum age of 2 years, and obesity was not defined for patients aged under 2 years [9]. Patients who tested negative for respiratory virus on RT-PCR and those with two or more viruses detected on RT-PCR were excluded. Patients were hospitalized until their respiratory symptoms and fever improved.
index 3
data On the first day of admission, samples were obtained from throat or nasal swabs and immediately sent to the laboratory for RT-PCR. The nucleic acids were extracted using Ribospin™ vRD (GeneAll Biotechnology Co., Seoul, Korea), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were synthesized from the extracted RNAs with the cDNA Synthesis Premix (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea). All samples were tested using the Anyplex II RV16 (Seegene Inc.) kit. The respiratory virus detection reaction was divided into two panels, A (adenovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus 1, parainfluenza virus 2, parainfluenza virus 3, parainfluenza virus 4, rhinovirus A/B/C) and B (respiratory syncytial virus A, respiratory syncytial virus B, bocavirus 1/2/3/4, metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, enterovirus). RT-PCR was run on CFX96 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) RT-PCR instrument, where viral respiratory pathogens were identified by a specific melting temperature of the amplicon labeled with one out of four fluorophores.
index 4
data Blood tests were also conducted on the first day of admission. The normal ranges for ALT and AST varied with patient sex and age, and were defined as follows: for ALT, less than 40 IU/L for boys younger than 1 month, 32 IU/L for girls younger than 1 month, and 45 IU/L for both boys and girls older than 1 month; for AST, less than 71 IU/L for infants under 1 month, less than 63 IU/L for infants aged between 1 and 12 months, less than 60 IU/L for children aged between 1 and 3 years, less than 50 IU/L for children aged between 3 and 9 years, and less than 40 IU/L for children older than 9 years [1]. To compare the degree of increase in ALT and AST levels, we calculated the proportion of increase above the normal increase rates and defined this as the rates of increase in ALT and AST levels.
index 5
data The patients were divided into those with increased levels of ALT or AST and those with normal levels, to compare the two groups in terms of sex, age, length of hospital stay, white blood cell count, leukocyte differential count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet, ALT, AST, protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels. Further, patients with increased ALT and AST levels were individually compared with those in the normal group, and blood test results were compared in accordance with the type of respiratory virus.
index 6
data Statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics ver. 18.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were analyzed using the unpaired 2-tailed t-test or analysis of variance, and categorical data were analyzed by using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all tests.
index 7
data Among all subjects, 339 patients who tested negative for respiratory virus on RT-PCR and 142 patients with two or more viruses detected on RT-PCR were excluded. A total of 532 patients were included in the study (304 boys [57.1%] and 228 girls [42.9%]). The mean age of the patients was 25.0±27.6 months and the mean length of hospital stay was 4.5±3.0 days. ALT levels exceeded the normal range in 45 of the 532 patients (8.5%), and AST level exceeded the normal range in 59 patients (11.1%) (Fig. 1).
index 8
data In total, 71 patients (13.3%) had increased ALT or AST levels. The male to female ratio in the increased ALT or AST groups (44:27) and the mean patient age (23.8±39.1 months) were not significantly different from those in the normal group (260:201 and 25.2±25.5 months, respectively) (p=0.377 and 0.768, respectively). The mean length of hospital stay of patients in the increased ALT or AST group was about 1 day longer than that of patients in the normal group (5.3±3.1 days vs. 4.4±3.0 days, p=0.019). The blood test results showed that there were significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of segmented neutrophils, atypical lymphocytes, albumin levels, and alkaline phosphatase; however, most of them were within the normal range. Patients in the increased ALT or AST group showed greater increases in their lactate dehydrogenase levels (613±133 IU/L vs. 853±752 IU/L, p=0.009) (Table 1).
index 9
data There were 45 patients (8.5%) in the increased ALT group, with a male to female ratio of 28:17, mean age of 16.0±35.8 months, and mean length of hospital stay of 5.8±3.7 days. Compared with the normal group, patients in the increased ALT group were significantly younger and their mean hospital stay was longer (p=0.022 and 0.003, respectively). The mean ALT level was 136.9±131.2 IU/L, and the rate of increase of ALT level was 3.1±2.9. There were significant differences in the proportion of segmented neutrophils, proportion of lymphocytes, platelet count, protein, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase levels between the groups, but the differences were within the normal ranges (Table 2).
index 10
data There were 59 patients (11.1%) in the increased AST group, with a male to female ratio of 37:22, mean age of 24.8±36.7 months, and mean length of hospital stay of 5.2±3.3 days, which were not significantly different from the corresponding values in the normal group. The mean AST level was 128.3±143.3 IU/L and the rate of increase of AST level was 2.1±2.3. The lactate dehydrogenase level of these patients was 909±812 IU/L, which was increased by a significantly greater degree than the lactate dehydrogenase levels of patients in the normal group (p=0.007). There were significant differences in the proportion of atypical lymphocytes and albumin levels between the groups, but the differences were within the normal ranges (Table 2).
index 11
data A total of 131 patients (24.6%) were infected by respiratory syncytial virus A, 128 patients (24.1%) were infected by rhinovirus, and 58 patients (10.9%) were infected by metapneumovirus. The incidences of increased ALT or AST levels were the highest in patients with adenovirus infections (6/24, 25.0%), followed by those with enterovirus (2/11, 18.2%) and respiratory syncytial virus A (21/131, 16.0%) infections. There were no significant differences among the different types of virus infections in the aminotransferase concentrations and in the mean increase rate of ALT/AST and the AST:ALT ratio (Table 3).
index 12
data Nonspecific reactive hepatitis is defined as a secondary hepatic injury induced by a non-hepatic disease, without parenchymal liver damage. It is common for patients with a respiratory virus infection to lack clinical presentations while showing increased ALT or AST levels, which then drop to normal levels, with a good prognosis upon improvement of the infection. The exact mechanism is unknown, but Polakos et al. [10] reported that collateral damage seems to induce the condition, considering that apoptotic hepatocytes, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and Kupffer cells appear around the inflamed area, while the virus is not present in hepatocytes.
index 13
data Other studies on nonspecific reactive hepatitis have reported that it occurs more frequently in younger age groups [11]. In the present study, there was no significant difference between the age of patients with increased levels of either ALT or AST and that of patients with normal levels for both. However, when patients in the increased ALT and AST groups were separately analyzed, the mean age of patients in the increased ALT level group (16.0±35.8 months) was significantly lower than that of patients in the normal group (25.8±26.6 months). On the contrary, there was no significant age difference between patients in the increased AST level group and those in the normal group. This indicates that younger patients with respiratory virus infection are more vulnerable to nonspecific reactive hepatitis, and the degree of influence on hepatic function is better reflected via ALT than AST levels.
index 14
data Studies have suggested higher incidences of nonspecific reactive hepatitis in men than in women, but no sex-specific differences were found in the present study [11].
index 15
data The rate of increase of ALT levels in the present study was 3.1±2.9, which indicates an ALT level three times higher than the normal range. Considering that the increase rate of AST level was 2.1±2.3, we presumed that ALT level increases by a greater degree than AST level during a respiratory virus infection, which is similar to the manifestations of acute hepatitis [11121314].
index 16
data Lactate dehydrogenase level increased in both groups, but it increased significantly more in patients in the increased ALT or AST level group than in those in the normal group, which indicates a more severe overall tissue damage in patients in the increased ALT or AST level group.
index 17
data Several studies have reported the frequency of nonspecific reactive hepatitis among patients with respiratory virus infection in Korea and abroad. Jeon et al. [11] reported that 19.4% of patients with viral infection of the lower respiratory tract showed hepatic dysfunction, with the frequency of liver damage being the highest in respiratory syncytial virus infection (50%), followed by influenza (35.8%), adenovirus (7.1%), and parainfluenza (7.1%) virus infections. Another study also reported that 49% of patients who underwent artificial ventilation for respiratory syncytial virus-induced bronchiolitis had nonspecific reactive hepatitis [12]. In the present study, 13.3% of all infant patients showed increased ALT or AST levels, which was lower than the incidences reported by other studies, presumably because we excluded patients infected by two or more viruses in order to clarify virus-specific features. In addition, the proportions of patients with increased ALT or AST levels were 33.7% for influenza, 30.9% for respiratory syncytial virus, and 24% for adenovirus, which were different from those reported by previous studies.
index 18
data A previous study has reported that respiratory syncytial virus infection is associated with increased ALT and AST levels, but no differences in the levels were observed after respiratory syncytial virus infection in the present study [15].

data Bilirubin level was significantly high in patients in the enterovirus infection group (2.7±5.0, p=0.002). Adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus are known to induce hyperbilirubinemia along with hepatitis, but only patients in the enterovirus infection group showed increased levels of bilirubin in the present study [16]. Further, patients in the adenovirus infection group showed significantly high levels of C-reactive protein (4.8±4.9, p<0.001), which was in line with the findings of another study, where adenovirus infection showed more similarity with the clinical presentation of a bacterial infection than with infections caused by other types of viruses [17].
index 20
data The AST:ALT ratio is used as an indicator to determine the cause of liver disease based on the fact that AST increases in greater degrees than ALT in liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease. In the present study, there were no significant virus-specific differences in this ratio, which could be attributed to the small sample size of patients with increased ALT or AST levels [1314].
index 21
data We believe that one of the merits of this study is our exhaustive investigation of all patients admitted to a single university hospital for lower respiratory tract infection, and that it more clearly observed virus-specific features by excluding cases of double infections.
index 22
data One of the limitations of this study is that we could not survey the drug history of patients, which could influence the results of hepatic function tests, such as use of antipyretics and antibiotics at the time of admission; therefore, such patients were not excluded from the study. Further, we could not exclude the possibility of increased ALT or AST levels due to fever-induced muscle damage, as we could not examine the creatine phosphokinase levels of all patients. In addition, because we diagnosed respiratory virus only via RT-PCR testing, we could not exclude cases of past respiratory virus infection or false positives as well as patients with gastrointestinal infections [18].
index 23
data In this study, we found that different types of viruses that infect the lower respiratory tract did not significantly affect ALT and AST levels. However, nonspecific reactive hepatitis was more common among patients with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus infection as well as among patients who were infected at a younger age, and compared with the serum level of AST, serum level of ALT was a better indicator of the severity of nonspecific reactive hepatitis.

data With the demand for rapid and comprehensive detection of multiple agents in clinical diagnostics for humans and animals, single-organism molecular diagnostic methods for pathogen detection are burdensome unless used for large numbers of samples being tested for a single disease. In the veterinary context, high-throughput diagnostic methodologies are particularly important due to the additional need for covering pathogens from a wide variety of species. OneHealth approaches for management of food-borne disease and emerging pathogen surveillance are examples of testing needs that include a number of bacteria, viruses (DNA or RNA based), parasites, and fungi. The challenge to combining tests for multiple analytes together (multiplexing) in order to improve testing efficiency is a possible loss of sensitivity and a large burden for optimization and validation of assays.

data Nanoliter scale real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an alternative to the practice of multiplexing that allows many separate reactions to run simultaneously on the same sample1. The OpenArray platform is an application of this principle2; it combines microarray technology with real-time PCR. Based on the concept of spatial multiplexing, every sample is tested for a large number of targets in separate through-holes. This platform was initially used with cyanine-based double-stranded DNA binding chemistry2 and is now available for probe-based chemistry using dark quenching probes3. This platform has primarily been used for genetic profiling in humans4 and animals5. It was recently adapted to detect blood-borne DNA and RNA pathogens by Grigorenko et al.6 using a two-step reverse-transcription/pre-amplification (preamp) procedure.
index 1
data We describe here a one-step preamp-based procedure for detecting both types of pathogens in respiratory secretions and a variety of other sample types that can be performed entirely in a standard workday. Upon completion of the one-step preamp, samples are transferred to a 384-well plate, which is the format accepted by the automated liquid handling system that comes with this nanoscale PCR platform. The system draws the master mix and sample across the surface of up to 4 plates (192 samples and controls) at a time. Following this loading process, we describe how samples are amplified and analyzed using a macro spreadsheet that summarizes the average of 3 technical replicates for each sample/target combination in a table that fits on one printed page.
index 2
data A uniform method for analyzing extracted DNA and/or RNA from samples using this platform was established. A wide variety of samples were extracted, reverse-transcribed, and pre-amplified in a 96-well format, minimizing the potential for errors. Respiratory samples tested included nasal swabs, deep pharyngeal swabs, trans-tracheal washes, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung tissue. Since some of the agents tested may also be present in peripheral blood or feces, we incorporated those types of samples into the procedure. This streamlined workflow helps save time and resources compared to running experiments in multiple plates by enabling efficient testing through panel-based pathogen and toxin gene detection in place of individual testing. The respiratory panel demonstrated here had 18 assays each printed in triplicate through-holes, accommodating up to 48 samples per plate. The equine pathogens detected included equine adenovirus 1 and 2, equine arteritis virus, equine rhinitis virus A and B, equine herpesvirus (EHV) types 1 and 4, and Streptococcus equi. The canine pathogens included canine respiratory coronavirus (betacoronavirus), canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine pneumovirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Mycoplasma cynos. A universal influenza A assay and an internal control (MS2 RNA phage) were also included.
index 3
data NOTE: Keep all reagents and samples used in the preamp reaction on ice at all times. Following preamp, keep all reagents at room temperature.
index 4
data Note: Do not start filling the 384-well plate until all of the above steps are complete. Evaporation is a concern with small volumes — do not let the 384-well plate sit uncovered with liquid inside.
index 5
data Results are shown in Figures 1 and 2 for a representative RNA assay (influenza matrix) and DNA assay (EHV-1) with a combination of positive controls and clinical samples submitted for routine diagnostic testing. The fluorescence signals emitted throughout this typical reaction are shown in Figure 1, which plots raw fluorescence values per cycle. All relative cycle threshold (Ct) values were automatically generated by the amplification machine software. Background fluorescence was used as a separate metric for assessment of loading quality rather than incorporating it into the fluorescence readings prior to calculating Ct values.
index 6
data The analytical limit of detection (LOD) for each target was calculated based on the overall mean of the Ct values at the 95% detection level plus 2 standard deviations in a pool of controls for all targets. The highest dilution where at least 95% of the replicates were positive for the representative assays was 50 copies; detection of 5 copies was successful in 50% of replicates. Neither assay was detected at below one copy. The LODs for the RNA and DNA assay were calculated at Ct values of 21.92 and 20.05. These values were considered to be the cutoffs for reporting values as positive vs. suspect (potentially not repeatable).
index 7
data Other aspects of analytic performance of the targets was assessed using serial dilutions of pooled positive controls run on three different days (Figure 2). The average efficiencies of the representative RNA and DNA assays were 101.1% and 106.6%; the overall mean efficiency for all targets was 101.3%. The assays also had good linearity (R2>0.98). Variation within replicate through-holes typically was within standard deviations of 0.2 for both clinical samples and controls. No cross-reactivity between any of the targets was observed.
index 8
data The Final Results worksheet in the supplemental file shows representative quantitative results for 10 clinical diagnostic samples and 4 controls. The clinical samples are a subset of the types of samples routinely tested including nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, lung tissue, and fecal samples. One (equine) fecal sample in this set shows a failed MS2 internal control, which indicates the presence of inhibitors in the sample. This is typically managed by dilution of the eluted sample and/or re-extraction. As is the case here, the negative amplification control should be negative for all targets, and the negative extraction control should only contain the internal control. In the clinical set, samples produced Ct values for betacoronavirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine distemper virus A, canine parainfluenza virus, canine pneumovirus, and influenza A.

data Table 1. Schematic of the amplification plate and target locations. The plates used for nanoscale real-time PCR testing on this platform are microscope slide-sized and are arranged in 48 subarrays of 64 through-holes, with a total of 3,072 through-holes for individual reactions. One subarray is shown here, with 18 targets in triplicate. Each sample is added to one subarray by the liquid handler. Plates are coated with hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds to retain reagents in through-holes via surface tension. The stainless steel chip is "photolithographically patterned and wet-etched to form a rectilinear array of 3,072 micro-machined, 320 µm diameter holes of 33 nl each"2. Abbreviations for targets are as follows: BCOR, canine respiratory coronavirus (betacoronavirus); BORD, Bordetella bronchiseptica CAV, canine adenovirus; CPIV, canine parainfluenza virus; CPNV, canine pneumovirus; DISTA/B, canine distemper virus A and B; EADV1/2, equine adenovirus 1/2; EAV, equine arteritis virus; EHV1/4, equine herpesvirus type 1/4; ERVA/B, equine rhinitis virus A/B; IVM, influenza A matrix; MCYNOS, Mycoplasma cynos; MS2, internal control (MS2 RNA phage); SEQU, Streptococcus equi.

data Table 2. Plate transfer map. A color-coded plate transfer map for using a fixed 8-channel pipette to transfer from the 96-well preamp plate to the 384-well plate is shown. Alternately, an adjustable pipette may be used. The same procedure is performed each time regardless of how many samples are in the plate.
index 13
data Supplemental file. A macro-enabled spreadsheet file containing two macros for formatting results into a summary table (as described in the protocol) is provided. A typical result table generated by the macros is included in the file (under Final Results). The two macros will fill in the sample names in the first column (up to 48 samples) and the average of the three Ct values for each target for those with positive results; note that targets that did not amplify appear blank in this table. This can be easily printed on one piece of paper and used as a reference for checking the raw data efficiently. In the final results tab, representative results for 10 clinical samples and 4 controls are shown. Abbreviations for assay names are listed in the legend of Table 1.

index 14
data This procedure has been used for routine testing of respiratory pathogens in our laboratory over the course of six months (2-3 times per week). We have also had success using the same procedure for enteric pathogen profiling in fecal samples and bacterial isolates on a separately customized plate. Once the plates are produced, experienced staff can complete steps 2-7 within one standard workday. The most critical steps are the proper sealing of the preamp plate, the transfer of preamplified samples between plates (which must be done rapidly to prevent evaporation), and the final covering of the amplification plate. Use of the macro spreadsheet as a guide for result analysis (checking curves for samples and controls) was also critical as it greatly reduced the amount of time and paperwork needed for this process. The provided macro spreadsheet is an example; it would need to be modified or re-created for plates with different configurations. This can easily be performed by someone with basic spreadsheet knowledge.
index 15
data Due to the very small amount of sample loaded onto the amplification plate (33 nl), pre-amplification is required. In the optimization of this protocol (not shown), we compared a number of preamplification parameters including the master mix, addition of random primers, number of cycles, annealing time, and dilution prior to amplification. Each target had its own optimal conditions, and those described here represent those that yielded the best limit of detection overall for our panel. This panel covers a wide range of pathogenic targets and sample types that are encountered in routine veterinary diagnostic testing, but modifications to the preamplification procedures may be necessary for different panels. The manufacturer-optimized amplification conditions are based on a standard probe-based real-time PCR protocol with a 10 min at 95 °C enzyme activation followed by denaturation at 95 °C and annealing/extension at 60 °C. The primers and probes are pre-printed on the plates also using manufacturer-optimized conditions and therefore do not require titration. Combining the reverse-transcription and pre-amplification steps for all samples (regardless of the type of target) was necessary in order to maintain efficiency in the workflow. Having all samples reverse transcribed is also beneficial for maximizing sensitivity. Furthermore, use of a master mix for the preamp that is optimized for minimizing inhibitors allows versatility in combining different sample types on the same plate.
index 16
data The Center for Disease Control (CDC) influenza matrix assay described by Shu et al.7 and adapted here for nanoliter scale reactions is a universal influenza A assay that is appropriate for testing samples from humans and companion animals. It was designed for universal detection of the matrix gene of all influenza A viruses using microliter scale reactions. It has been used around the world as part of a CDC Human Influenza Virus Panel and a CDC Swine Flu Panel. The EHV-1 assay8 adapted here detects an important respiratory pathogen of horses that can cause abortions and neurologic disease (reviewed by Pusterla and Hussey10). The significance of adapting these tests to a high-throughput platform with a species-independent internal control is that they can be incorporated into a OneHealth surveillance approach. Having both of these assays on a high-throughput testing platform will facilitate emergency preparedness for clinical facilities, shelters, and performance events.
index 17
data The results described above were representative of all the targets on the plate with the exception of Mycoplasma cynos, which showed considerably more variation in analytic performance. This was likely due to the sub-optimal melting temperature (Tm) of the primers, which should ideally be 58-60 °C (the ideal probe Tm is 68-70 °C). A limitation of this platform is that it takes longer to design and manufacture the plates than for ordering individual probes, which limits the ability to quickly modify sequences. Another limitation of real-time PCR in general is the inability to detect novel or unexpected pathogens. This can be overcome to some extent by designing assays that match sequences in multiple species, but unbiased whole genome sequencing based methodologies are more suited for discovery of novel agents.11,12
index 18
data Nanoscale real-time PCR allows a new paradigm for syndrome-based rather than species-based testing, which is useful for reducing reagent and labor costs in high-throughput molecular diagnostics. Large-scale panel testing by this approach can facilitate OneHealth surveillance efforts such as those described by Dunne and Gurfield13 and Moutailler et al.14. Collection of swab samples early, generally within 3 days of clinical onset, provides the best chance to identify the presence of respiratory pathogens. Infectious disease emergence is often unpredictable, and tests that can be performed on different species without the need for modification of reagents are ideal for preparedness. Future applications of this technology are likely to be in pathotyping, antimicrobial resistance profiling, and further syndrome-based clinical diagnostic panels. Nanoscale real-time PCR is most useful for rapid, high-throughput screening of multiple sample and pathogen types, and would be complemented by unbiased or partially biased sequencing-based approaches for identifying new and emergent pathogens.

data A unique infrastructure and search strategy system distinguish the Eukaryotic Pathogen Database Resource (EuPathDB, http://eupathdb.org) from other organism databases. The power of EuPathDB lies in the ability to query across hundreds of data sets while refining a set of genes, proteins, pathways or organisms of interest. The interface is designed for easy mastery by biological researchers, enabling in silico experiments that interrogate diverse and complex data sets. Despite the sophisticated strategy system, browsing gene pages and genomic spans or regions remains a simple and informative task in this innovative and valuable resource.
index 0
data EuPathDB facilitates the discovery of meaningful biological relationships between genomic features such as genes or SNPs by integrating pre-analyzed data with sophisticated data mining, visualization and analysis tools that are designed to be used by wet-bench researchers. Organized into 13 free, online databases EuPathDB supports over 170 eukaryotic pathogens with genomic sequence and annotation, functional genomics data, host-response data, isolate and population data and comparative genomics. Table 1 provides a web address and a link to a list of organisms supported for each database. All databases are built with the same infrastructure and use the Strategies Web Development Kit (1), which provides a graphical interface for building complex search strategies and exploring relationships across data sets and data types (Figure 1; strategy http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/im.do?s=7b88206dd42007c8).
index 1
data As one of four National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID/NIH) funded Bioinformatics Resource Centers (2–6) EuPathDB provides data, tools and services to scientific communities researching pathogens in the NIAID list of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases which includes NIAID category A–C priority pathogens and many fungi. Additional EuPathDB support for the kinetoplastid and fungal research communities is funded by The Wellcome Trust in collaboration with GeneDB (7), including support for focused curated annotation. This manuscript describes expanded content, features and tools added since 2013 that increase the data mining and discovery power of EuPathDB.
index 2
data EuPathDB resources have been expanded to include FungiDB (http://fungidb.org) (8), which supports fungi and oomycetes, and HostDB (http://hostdb.org), for interrogation of host responses to infection. HostDB supports host data obtained during infections by organisms supported by EuPathDB's 10 parasite lineage-specific databases. Minot et al. (9), for example, infected murine macrophages with 29 Toxoplasma gondii strains and collected mixed parasite–host samples for RNA sequencing. Reads that align to the T. gondii genome are integrated into ToxoDB whereas HostDB houses those sequencing reads that align to the M. musculus genome. Because all EuPathDB databases employ the same data analysis pipelines, search strategy system, visualization and analysis tools, the T. gondii and M. musculus data can be compared. For example, one can easily identify parasite genes that are differentially expressed between two T. gondii strains from ToxoDB as well as host genes that are differentially expressed during infection with the same two strains from HostDB. Enrichment analyses and comparison of these lists offers insights into host–pathogen interactions and responses.
index 3
data EuPathDB sites now include a Galaxy-based (10) workspace for large-scale data analyses, e.g. RNA-seq read mapping to a reference genome. Developed in partnership with Globus Genomics (11), workspaces offer a private analysis platform with published workflows and pre-loaded annotated genomes for the organisms we support. The workspace is accessed through the ‘Analyze My Experiment’ (Figure 2A) tab on the home page of any EuPathDB resource and can be used to upload your own data e.g. RNA-seq reads, compose and run preconfigured or custom workflows (Figure 2B and C), retrieve your results, visualize them in EuPathDB (Figure 2D), and share workflows and data analysis results with colleagues.
index 4
data Transcript subsets occur when a multi-transcript gene has at least one transcript that does not meet the search criteria. For example, signal peptides are short sequences at the N-terminus of secretory proteins and EuPathDB predicts signal peptides for all annotated genomes using SignalP (12). The Predicted Signal Peptide search returns genes and transcripts with predicted signal peptides. If one transcript of a multi-transcript gene excludes the exon containing the signal peptide, the search returns the gene but not the signal peptide-deficient transcript. Searches and strategies that query transcript-specific data (Figure 3A; strategy http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/im.do?s=859df329f857438e) are equipped with an Explore tool for interrogating or filtering transcript subsets. The explore tool appears in the Gene Results tab above the table of IDs (Figure 3C) and offers filters for transcripts based on their inclusion in the result set. Filters are applied to the strategy result and update the gene result list. For two-step strategies where both steps query transcript specific data, the explore tool offers further filters for viewing transcripts that were returned by both searches, either search or neither search.
index 5
data Gene Ontology, Metabolic Pathway and Word enrichment analyses are available for gene strategy results to aid with their interpretation (Figure 3F). These functional analyses apply the Fisher's Exact test to determine over-represented pathways, ontology terms and product description terms. Clicking the Analyze Results tab of any gene strategy result (Figure 3E) and selecting an enrichment analysis will open an analysis tab where users are prompted for parameter values. The results of an enrichment analysis are presented in tabular form and include a list of enriched GO terms, pathways or product description words and associated data.
index 6
data Strategies marked as Public when saved to a user's profile will also be shared with the community in the ‘Public Strategies’ tab of the ‘My Strategies’ interface. Users control the availability of the strategy and can remove it at any time. The panel also includes example strategies provided by EuPathDB.
index 7
data Each data set integrated into EuPathDB is documented with a data set record which contains information about the data including a description, contact information for the investigator that generated the data, literature references, and when available, example graphs and links to searches and genome browser tracks. Links to data set records appear on gene pages and on search pages beneath the parameters. A searchable table of all data sets is available from the Data Summary tab in the gray drop-down menu bar.
index 8
data EuPathDB resources now support over 170 organisms with 255 genome sequences, 199 of which include genome-wide annotation. The addition of FungiDB as a EuPathDB resource brought many genomes from this large and diverse research community. Updates to EuPathDB's Reflow workflow system (2) make it possible to quickly and reliably analyze and load data. Thus, over the past 4 years, numerous functional data sets have been loaded. Data sets of interest can be located with the data set search tool described above.
index 9
data This new data type offers a measure of host response to infection by revealing pathogen-specific antibodies in host serum or plasma samples. A typical data set includes data from serum samples collected from patients during an infection (or from healthy controls) that were hybridized to arrays spotted with possible pathogen antigens (peptides representing gene products) (13–16). Searches that query this data type are classified under Immunology and graphs of a pathogen gene's antigenicity for each sample appear on gene pages. The searches employ the filter parameter for selecting samples based on clinical characteristics of patients when configuring the search (17).
index 10
data Pathways are integrated from MetaCyc, KEGG, TrypanoCyc and LeishCyc (18–22) as networks of enzymatic reactions and substrate/product compounds. Genes are mapped to Pathways based on EC numbers. Pathway record pages feature a Cytoscape image which can be ‘painted’ with experimental data, e.g. gene expression values or ortholog profiles. For easy transition to functional analysis, gene search results can be converted to pathways using the Transform to Pathways function in the Add Step popup or users can run a pathways enrichment analysis of their gene result to identify pathways that are statistically enriched.
index 11
data Compound records are integrated from the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database (23) and associated to genes through metabolic pathway mappings. Lists of compounds are returned based on molecular weight or formula, compound ID, enzyme EC number, Compound ID and text. Lists of genes and metabolic pathways can be transformed into their associated compounds using the Transform function.
index 12
data A genome-wide loss of function screen using CRISPR technology is available in ToxoDB and provides a measure of a gene's contribution to parasite fitness (24). Phenotypes represent the fitness of CRISPR gene knockout organisms based on comparing the frequency of guide RNA sequences remaining in culture after three lytic cycles to the original guide RNA library. A search categorized under Phenotypes returns genes based on phenotype score. A GBrowse track showing guide RNAs mapped against the T. gondii GT1 genome is available.
index 13
data Phenotypes curated from the literature for several Aspergillus and Cryptococcus strains are now integrated into FungiDB. Phenotypes curated from the literature by the Sanger Institute's Pathogen Genomics Group based on siRNA data are available in TriTrypDB for T. brucei brucei strain 927. A phenotype table appears on the record pages of genes that have curated phenotypes. A search returning genes based on the phenotype is available and categorized under Phenotype in both FungiDB and TriTrypDB.
index 14
data This new data type provides evidence for differential protein expression from experimental methods such as SILAC (25,26). The searches appear under the Proteomics, Quantitative Mass-Spec Evidence and return genes based on the fold change in protein expression between samples. Gene pages include graphs of these data when available.
index 15
data Whole genome resequencing data are used to estimate chromosome and gene copy number in re-sequenced strains (27). The median read depth is set to the organism's ploidy and each chromosome's median read depth is normalized to this value. Contigs that are not assigned to chromosomes are excluded from this analysis. Gene copy number is similarly calculated using a normalized read depth for each gene. To compare the number of genes in the re-sequenced genome to the reference genome, genes are grouped into clusters that are inferred to have originated by duplication. Searches are categorized under Genetic Variation and either return genes with a certain copy number, or genes with different copy numbers between strains.
index 16
data RNA-sequencing of polysome or ribosome associated transcripts reveals potential translation events. Data sets of this data type are available in PlasmoDB (28,29) and TryTripDB (30). Categorized under Transcriptomics, RNA Seq Evidence, the searches against this new data type return genes with differential translation potential (Fold Change search) or genes within a certain percentile rank within a sample. Expression graphs and RNA sequencing coverage plots are available statically in gene pages and dynamically in GBrowse. These coverage plots provide evidence for the CDS and translational start site usage.
index 17
data Biological sample characteristics such as host clinical parameters for pathogen isolates or blood samples offer valuable information for stratifying samples while configuring searches. EuPathDB integrates metadata when available and presents it in the filter parameter interface to take advantage of the rich data type when selecting samples for data mining (see below).
index 18
data Searches, the experimental data sets they query, and genome browser tracks for visualization are now displayed with a common logic across the websites. The categories are based on the EMBRACE Data & Methods Ontology (EDAM) (31), which relates biological concepts with bioinformatic analyses. The result is a logical, consistent menu structure from home page to gene page to genome browser. For example, the category names and order in the home page ‘Search for Genes’ (Figure 1B) is the same as the ‘Contents’ section of the gene page (Figure 4C).
index 19
data EuPathDB's extensive record system documents integrated data and analysis results for entities such as Genes, Genomic Sequences, SNPs, Isolates, Compounds and Metabolic Pathways. Record pages have a new streamlined look, contain improved navigation tools, and are reorganized to reflect EDAM-based categories (Figure 4). To view the gene page for PF3D7_0905700, autophagy-related protein 3, putative that is highlighted in Figure 4, go to http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/record/gene/PF3D7_0905700. For example, in gene record pages, gene IDs and product descriptions are prominently displayed in the upper left corner of the page with other pertinent gene information and links directly below (Figure 4A). Also at the top of the page are ‘Shortcuts’ (Figure 4B) which serve two functions—clicking on the Shortcut's magnifying glass icon offers a larger view of the data, while clicking on the image (or its title) navigates to the data within the gene page. ‘View in Genome Browser’ links (e.g. above and below the Gene Models image in Figure 4D) accompany data that are also available for dynamic viewing in the Genome Browser. These links open the Genome Browser (GBrowse) (32) with the pertinent data track added to the user's current browser session.
index 20
data The collapsible and interactive ‘Contents’ section reflects the new EDAM-based categories and features a search function for quickly locating a category (Figure 4C). The contents section remains stationary and visible while scrolling the gene page data (Figure 4D). A section indicator (small blue circle) appears to the left of the category name of the data currently in view. Clicking a category name directs the page to that data section. The check boxes to the right of the category names can be used to customize the data display. Data from categories with empty check boxes will be hidden from view.
index 21
data Data tables (4E, 4F and within Figure 4D) are collapsible, interactive, contain sortable columns and present transcript-specific information when data can be unambiguously assigned to a transcript. Tables with two or more rows include a search function. The Transcriptomics (Figure 4E), Protein Properties and Features (Figure 4F), Mass Spec -based Expression Evidence and Sequences tables contain expandable rows for retrieving detailed information. Each row of the Transcriptomics table represents a data set and expanding a row reveals graphs, data tables, and a data set description, as well as coverage plots for RNA sequencing data. Expansion of the rows in the Protein Properties and Features table reveals the domains, BLASTP hits and other analysis results pertinent to the transcript's protein product. The Mass Spec-based Expression Evidence Graphic table shows proteomic evidence associated with each transcript. The Sequences table offers genomic, coding, predicted mRNA and predicted protein sequences for each transcript.
index 22
data Human and mouse genes (HostDB) have extensive alternative transcripts and there is increasing evidence that many eukaryotic pathogen genes have more than one transcript. EuPathDB infrastructure was updated to better represent transcript information. Transcripts are graphically represented on gene pages and listed in gene page tables when data can be unambiguously assigned to a transcript (Figure 4D). All gene search results now include a Transcript ID column (Figure 3C). The results of searches that query transcript-specific data (e.g. Predicted Signal Peptide) contain an Explore Tool (see Tools section of this manuscript) for investigating transcript subsets (Figure 3B).
index 23
data Sequences from pathogen isolates and data from host clinical blood samples are often accompanied by rich metadata-sample characteristics including host, age, geographic location, disease status and parasitemia. EuPathDB's new filter parameter (Figure 5) increases the user's power to mine data via display of sample characteristics (metadata) on the interface for selection of samples while configuring a search or multiple sequence alignment. For example, the filter parameter makes it possible to compare the antigenicity of parasite genes between infected children and uninfected children within the same dataset. The filter parameter is available for searches and sequence alignments that access SNP, ChIP-seq and host-response data.
index 24
data Our pipeline for analyzing and loading RNA-sequence data was updated to use standard tools and to accommodate data sets with biological replicates. The new workflow aligns reads with GSNAP and calculates FPKM/RPKM with HT-Seq (33,34). DESeq2 is used to determine differential expression for experiments that have appropriate biological replicates (35).

data Future development efforts at EuPathDB will concentrate on expanding private analysis workspaces and better integration and support for host response to pathogen infection. The Galaxy toolshed contains many tools for data analysis. We expect to enhance our existing Galaxy workspace with new workflows such as alignment of re-sequencing reads and SNP calls or production of multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses. Critical to our expanded workspace will be the ability for users to fully integrate the results of their analyses into EuPathDB so that they can query, view, and share their results in the context of the publicly available data in EuPathDB.
index 26
data A high priority for EuPathDB in the coming year is to better represent host responses to pathogen infection and enable users to mine these data to identify genes (or other entities) and relationships of interest. Currently, only a few omics data sets are available for host response, but we expect this situation to change rapidly. We will be expanding not only the amount of host data that we load, but also the types of host response data so that we can include high-throughput metabolic and immune profiling and rich descriptions of all study, experiment and sample metadata. We will be loading these rich multi-dimensional studies and we will be implementing a variety of tools and analyses to mine these data at a systems level.

data Since the 1950s, glucocorticoids had been widely used in clinical practice as an effective means of treating diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and those caused by kidney transplantation, resulting in an increase in the number of steroid-associated necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH) cases (1–3). SANFH is the most common cause of non-traumatic osteonecrosis (2). For the past 40 years, Chinese and foreign researchers have investigated SANFH; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. There are a variety of theories as to what is associated with the pathogenesis SANFH, including dyslipidemia, intravascular coagulation, immune complex deposition-induced arterial inflammation, osteoporosis, venous stasis-induced intra-bone high pressure and hormonal toxicity of bone cells. The above theories also did not clearly prove that the bone cells exhibited necrosis, because no necrosis-specific inflammatory responses cell swelling were found (4–8). Therefore, SANFH lacks effective prevention and early treatment strategies (9). Previous studies have shown that hormones not only promote the apoptosis of bone cells, osteoblasts and cartilage cells, but are involved in the pathological process of femoral head necrosis (10,11). The present study utilized single low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus methylprednisolone (MPS) to establish a rabbit model of SANFH. The roles of levodopa (LEV) in cellular apoptosis were observed in the rabbit model of SANFH, with the aim of providing a basis for the prevention and early treatment of femoral head necrosis.
index 0
data A total of 44 healthy Chinese adult rabbits (age, 3.5±0.4 months; 2.5±0.5 kg; half male and half female; provided by Animal Center of Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China) were bred in individual cages (20–30°C; 30–70% humidity, 12 h: 12-h light-dark cycle; free access to feed and water). The present study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The animal use protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Soochow University (Suzhou, China).
index 1
data Rabbits were randomly divided into three groups. Group A (n=15), the model group, was injected with 10 µg/kg LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4; 10 mg; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) through the ear vein, and 20 mg/kg MPS (500 mg/bottle; H20060052; Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY, USA) into the right gluteus 24 h later, for a total of three times with a 24-h interval between injections. Group B (n=15), the treatment group, was prepared using the same protocol as the model group, followed by oral administration of LEV (0.4 g/kg/day; Shanghai Fuda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) immediately after modeling. Group C (n=14), the control group, was injected with the same volume of normal saline in the same manner and at the same time points as the above two groups. During the experiment, all rabbits were injected with penicillin (800,000 U/per rabbit, twice per week; Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Harbin, China) in order to prevent infection. Following imaging observation, seven rabbits from each group were sacrificed via air embolism at the 6th- and 8th-week of the experiment for subsequent analysis.
index 2
data Prior to sacrifice, 10% chloral hydrate (volume fraction) anesthesia was intraperitoneally injected into the rabbits, and dual-hip X-ray (V-5000; Phillips Healthcare, DA Best, The Netherlands) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (0.2T E-Scan; Esaote Europe BV, Cambridge, UK) were performed to observe whether there patchy density-reduced shadows were present in the X-ray images of the rabbit femoral head area. During MRI examination, rabbits were placed in the supine position, with their lower leg flexed and fixed with tape. Using a knee coil, conventional SE sequence T1-weighted imaging was performed [repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)=490/14 msec], in addition to T2-weighted imaging (TR/TE=2632/96 msec), with no interval and the following parameters: Matrix, 128×256; vision, 14×14 cm; thickness, 3 mm. T1-weighted images demonstrated spotty, thin-thread and patchy low signals, and T2-weighted images showed spotty, thin-thread or patchy low or high signals, which were considered to indicate femoral head necrosis.
index 3
data Six or eight weeks later, the rabbits of the three groups were sacrificed via air embolism, then their bilateral femoral heads were harvested, split in half along the central coronal plane, placed in 10% neutral formalin solution for 24-h fixation and decalcified in 5% dilute nitric acid for one week. Following dehydration in an alcohol series the femoral heads were embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-µm-thick slices, dewaxed and hydrated prior to staining with hematoxylin for 5 min. Following staining, the slices were hydrated for 10 min, eosin-stained for 2 min, dehydrated, hyalinized and turpentine-mounted before the bone trabecular structure and changes in the bone cells and bone marrow fats were observed under a light microscope. Femoral head necrosis was determined according to the pathological features of empty bone lacuna numbers and surrounding necrotic bone marrow tissues. Any region in the slice that was found to exhibit one sign of osteonecrosis was considered to be positive for SANFH. Pathological changes in bone cellular necrosis were expressed as the percentage of empty bone lacunae. At ×100 magnification in 10 randomly selected high-power fields, the number of empty bone lacunae out of 50 bone lacunae in each field were counted to calculate the percentage of empty bone lacunae.
index 4
data Paraffinized sections of the femoral head were used to study cellular apoptosis using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) kit (KGA703; KGI Biological Technology Development Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China), with 3,3′-daminobenzidine staining. Observed under the microscope, the nucleus was stained as tan or brown and set as the positive result. Five fields were randomly selected under ×400 magnification for observation, the proportion of apoptotic cells in 50% of the vision field were counted and indicated as the apoptosis index (AI).
index 5
data Prior to sacrificing the rabbits at the 8th week, 2 ml of blood was harvested from the central ear artery of each rabbit in each group between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 4°C (3,600 r/min; 20 min) to isolate the serum and were stored at −20°C. The serum IGF-1 level was determined by radioimmunoassay using IGF-1 RIA kits (Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology And Service Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) according to manufacturer's instructions.
index 6
data Data were processed using SPSS 13.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and expressed as mean ± standard deviation (x ± s). Analysis of variance was performed, as was Pearson's correlation analysis and linear regression. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
index 7
data One week after MPS was injected, the rabbits in groups A and B exhibited gradually increased food intake and general motor activity. Three weeks after MPS was injected, 50% of the rabbits in group A exhibited reduced motor activity and significant weight loss (P<0.05), whereas the rabbits in group B exhibited normal motor activity without any significant changes in body weight. One rabbit in groups A and B, respectively, succumbed to anaphylactic shock 48 h after LPS injection. No mortality was observed in group C, and the rabbits exhibited good spirits, normal appetite, shiny fur and normal weight gain.
index 8
data In group A at the 6th week, dual-hip X-ray demonstrated a normal femoral head, whereas the bone density was less uniform, with cystic degeneration. At the 8th week, the femoral head exhibited partial collapse, the density of the majority of the femoral bone was uneven, with visible cystic degeneration or sclerotic bone, or ‘crescent sign’. The joint space was normal or slightly narrowed, and the bone trabeculae was partially disrupted. In group B at the 6th week, dual-hip X-ray demonstrated a normal femoral head with uniform bone density, without sclerotic bone or cystic degeneration. At the 8th week, the majority of femoral heads exhibited a normal appearance without collapse; the bone density was evenly increased without cystic degeneration or ‘crescent sign’, and the joint space was normal. Group C exhibited a normal appearance (Fig. 1).
index 9
data T1-weighted images of groups A (n=11) and B (n=7) demonstrated that the femoral heads exhibited spotty, thin-thread, patchy low signals, and the T2-weighted images were also spotty, thin-thread, patchy high or low signals. Fat-suppression images were spotty, thin-thread, patchy high signals (Fig. 2). Group C exhibited no abnormal MR signals.
index 10
data In group A at the 6th week, the bone trabeculae became thinner, sparser, the intramedullary hematopoietic cells were decreased, the fat cells proliferated and exhibited hypertrophy, and partial bone cellular nuclei were deeply stained. At the 8th week, the subchondral bone plate of the femoral head and the bone trabeculae became thinner, the continuity was interrupted, more bone cellular nuclei exhibited karyopyknosis, and the nuclei were deviated and deeply stained. The changes in the subchondral bone marrow area included: Large bone marrow fat tissues exhibited steatosis and dissolved; necrosis was aggravated; intramedullary vessels were compressed; the lumina was narrowed with visible fat emboli and thrombosis (Fig. 3); partial bones exhibited degeneration and necrosis; the number of normal cells in bone trabeculae were reduced; bone cells disappeared in the partial bone lacuna; and the empty bone lacuna were significantly increased (P<0.01), with aggravated vacuole degrees in bone lacuna. The average rate of empty bone lacunae was 33.86±8.38%.
index 11
data In group B at weeks 6–8, the bone trabecular structures were intact and arranged regularly, without continuous interruption; empty bone lacunae was partially visible, and the average rate of empty bone lacunae was 25.97±6.29%, which was higher than the group C control group 11.83±2.45% (P<0.01) and lower than than group A (P<0.01). Intramedullary blood vessels were normal, without significant formation of blood clots and fat embolism, and steatosis of the intramedullary stromal cells was decreased. In the necrotic areas, fiber tissues repair could be seen, with increased osteoblasts and capillary proliferation, and cartilages exhibited obvious bone formation.
index 12
data Group C exhibited normal integral structures of the femoral head. The empty bone lacuna rates of the femoral heads of each group are shown in Table I.
index 13
data Specimens in group A exhibited the highest rate of apoptosis of the bone cells, with apoptosis-positive cells containing brown particles visible in the bone lacuna. A large number of apoptotic bone cells were observed inside the bone trabeculae. Group B exhibited moderate apoptosis of the bone cells, whereas group C exhibited minimal apoptotic bone cells (Fig. 4). The AI of each group is shown in Table I.
index 14
data Group A exhibited a positive correlation between TUNEL-positive AI and empty bone lacuna rate, with a coefficient r=0.74 (P<0.01) and a regression equation of y=30.77+4.39x, indicating that early SANFH was related with cellular apoptosis in the present study (Fig. 5).
index 15
data Serum IGF-1 levels in groups A, B and C were 10.12±2.49, 14.78±2.37 and 7.91±0.85 ng/ml, respectively. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the differences were statistically significant (F=20.5558; P<0.01). Comparison between groups A and C exhibited no statistically significant difference (P=0.058); whereas the serum IGF-1 content of group B was significantly higher than that of groups A and C (P<0.01).
index 16
data Cellular apoptosis was first proposed by Kerr in 1972 (12). Cellular apoptosis is an active process which has been confirmed to be gene-regulated programmed cell death, also known as programmed cell death. In a previous study on this topic, Weinstein et al (13) performed surgical resection of the femoral head in 14 patients with NFH caused by steroid induction (n=5), alcoholism (n=3), trauma (n=1) and sickle cell disease (n=5), and used TUNEL staining to detect the apoptotic cells. The results revealed that SANFH induced the apoptosis of a large number of bone cells, whereas patients with alcoholism-induced NFH exhibited less apoptotic cells, and no apoptotic cells were detected in the cases of NFH induced by the remaining causes. Therefore, it was concluded that SANFH was induced by the apoptosis of bone cells; however, this study was unable to prove the existence of apoptosis inside the necrotic bone cells of femoral head. Eberhardt et al (14) discovered that large doses of hormones were able to cause changes in cellular viabilities, with apoptosis demonstrated to be the primary change of SANFH. When bone cellular apoptosis was widespread, although blood vessels had no significant change, bone necrosis had already occurred. Calder et al (15) performed an immunohistochemical study of specimens from patients with non-traumatic osteonecrosis, and found that the nitric oxide synthase content was increased, which was considered to be due to the hormone's direct cytotoxic effects, leading to increased nitric oxide and mediating the occurrence of apoptosis. It was suggested that the apoptosis of bone cells has an important role in the pathogenesis of femoral head necrosis. In addition, it was shown that glucocorticoids are able to affect the proliferation and differentiation of bone cells, thus affecting the reconstruction and resorption of bones and decreasing the bone conversion rate, which further leads to osteoporosis, and the deposit of apoptotic bone cells (16). Glucocorticoids were recognized as one of factors that may contribute cellular apoptosis (17), thus promoting the apoptosis of osteoblasts and bone cells, leading to the reduction of bone cells. Furthermore, glucocorticoids may also affect the functions of osteoblasts, thus delaying bone formation and resulting in bone loss.
index 17
data The findings of the present study indicated that apoptotic bone cells were detected in the three groups, and the number of these apoptotic cells was significantly increased in group A compared with groups B and C. TUNEL assay analysis demonstrated that, 6 weeks after medication, the number of apoptotic bone cells of group A was 102.56±18.96%, which was significantly higher than group C 47.23±10.12%. As time increased to 8 weeks after treatment, the number of apoptotic bone cells increased further, was demonstrated to be positively correlated with the increasing empty bone lacuna. This phenomenon was most obvious in the subchondral area, which is consistent with the changing sites of empty bone lacuna, indicating that bone cellular apoptosis has an important role in early SANFH. These findings also suggested that hormones may increase the apoptosis of bone cells, thus affecting bone metabolism and bone mass changes.
index 18
data The present study also investigated the interventional effects of LEV on rabbit SANFH. In a previous study, Pritchett (18) orally administered LEV to treat delayed fracture healing, and 84% of patients achieved fracture healing. Therefore, in the present study LEV was orally administered to liquid nitrogen-induced experimental NFH animal models, which indicated that the formation of new bones in the necrotic areas was higher than in the control group. The present study was designed to further investigate the mechanism of this drug.
index 19
data L-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) alanine (LEV), which is the L-isomer of dopa, was absorbed inside the intestine after oral administration to subsequently peak at a plasma concentration of 1–2 h. When LEV enters the central nervous system, it may increase the concentration of dopamine at the median eminence, stimulating dopamine receptors to increase the level of norepinephrine inside the hypothalamus. The latter would then excite the α-receptor and promote the release of growth hormone releasing factor, leading to the increased secretion of growth hormone (GH). GH is able to promote the synchronic proliferation of proosteoblasts and osteoblasts in fractures and peri-periosteal cambium layer, thus accelerating the repair process of NFH (19). In addition, GH promotes the secretion of IGF-1 and other factors; IGF-1 is able to promote the synthesis of DNA and RNA in cartilage cells and cell mitosis to accelerate the speed of cartilaginous ossification. Previous in vitro studies have shown that IGF-1 inhibits the apoptosis of bone cells and osteoblasts, inducing the growth and maturation of bones and cartilages, reducing subendosteal bone resorption, increasing the net increase of bone mass, and thereby reducing the incidence of NFH and accelerating the repair process (19).
index 20
data Hill et al (20) considered that there were a variety of extracellular signals that may affect the viability of osteoblasts. For example, lacking GF, IGF and bone nutrients results in osteoblasts prematurely entering apoptosis; whereas IGF-1, insulin and basic fibroblast growth factor are able to prevent the apoptosis of osteoblasts. Tumor necrosis factor-α may promote the apoptosis of osteoblasts, among which IGF-1 has been demonstrated to be one of the major growth factors that promotes bone formation. Glucocorticoids are able to inhibit IGF-1 gene transcription inside osteoblasts, thereby regulating the expression of IGF-1 in osteoblasts.
index 21
data IGF-1 is also a major regulator of anti-apoptotic signals. Glucocorticoids have been demonstrated to inhibit the autocrine and (or) paracrine signaling pathways of IGF-1; thus promoting apoptosis (21,22) and suppressing the formation of osteoblasts, resulting in reduced bone formation and the accumulation of apoptotic cells, which subsequently leads to bone necrosis (23).
index 22
data The results of the present study demonstrated that the animals in group B exhibited a more typically shaped femoral head with no collapse on dual-hip X-ray at the 8th week, and the bone density was uniformly increased, which was distinct from the group A. Histopathological analysis showed that the bone trabecular structures were substantially complete and arranged regularly with no continuous interruption, although partial empty bone lacunae were visible. The average rate of empty bone lacunae was 25.97±6.29% in group B, which was significantly lower than group A (33.86±8.38%) and significantly higher than group C (11.83±2.45%). The necrotic area exhibited the repair of fibrous tissues; the osteoblasts were increased, the capillaries were proliferated, and the osteoblasts were active. These findings showed that LEV was able to reduce the incidence of NFH; furthermore, LEV accelerated the repair of necrotic areas. TUNEL assay results demonstrated that the treatment group exhibited scattered positive cells with brown particles inside the partial bone nuclei, with AI as 120.67 ± 13.13%, which was significantly lower than that of group A (202.02±18.99%). These findings suggest that LEV may reduce the apoptosis of bone cells, thereby preventing NFH. The results showed that the serum IGF-1 levels in group B were significantly increased, compared with group A, indicating the biological pathway of LEV may function through the promotion the synthesis and release of IGF-1, thus reducing bone cellular apoptosis, reducing the incidence of NFH, and accelerating the repair of necrotic areas.

data Viruses are key players in nature able to infect organisms from the three domains of life and found across all known ecological niches (1) therefore affecting biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem dynamics (1–5). However, due to limitations primarily related to identifying and culturing them, the detection of environmental viruses remained very limited until the advent of metagenomic approaches (6). Since then, a number of environmental viromes have been scrutinized providing a broader view of the diversity and distribution of viruses (7–13). Unfortunately, this information usually remains scattered across different repositories -such as general data repository databases (e.g. GenBank (14) or EMBL (15)), or virus-specific databases (e.g. virus pathogen resource (16)), recombinant virus database (17), and hepatitis B database (18)). Furthermore, metadata such as isolation source or habitat where the virus was originally identified, or information about its putative host, often remains elusive or not available in several of these databases. More recent works are making a great progress towards an effort to provide a centralized resource for viral data and associated tools (19). However, despite the excellent existing resources, we still lack a data management and visualization environment integrating viral genes, genomes, clusters, functions, associated host and habitat with analytical tools that would enable large-scale comparative analysis of the global virome.
index 0
data In order to alleviate some of the existing resource limitations, and enable the community to access and analyze an expanded version of the recently emerging viral genomics data we have developed IMG/VR, an integrated viral analysis system, within the Integrated Microbial Genomes with Microbiome samples (IMG/M) data management system (20).
index 1
data IMG/VR provides the largest integration of viral sequences with associated metadata and allows users to explore these data to decipher biogeographical and habitat distribution patterns of viral species as well as traveling across all the identified hosts putatively infected with viral sequences. In addition, users can compare and analyze their sequences against IMG/VR's data (including viral protein family models, viral cluster and singleton information, distribution patterns of similar viral sequences across the globe, percent of known and unknown genes per sequence, and information regarding viral taxonomy and putative viral-host(s)), integrated with a variety of analytical tools.
index 2
data We anticipate that IMG/VR will become a reference resource for sequence analysis of viral genomes and viral contigs derived from metagenomic samples.
index 3
data The IMG/VR system is an integrated resource for viral data management and associated metadata within the IMG/M system (20). In its first public release, IMG/VR contains a total of 268 320 viral sequences from both isolate viral genomes (iVGs) and metagenomic viral contigs (mVCs). The 264 413 mVCs currently provided by the system were obtained from 2981 metagenomic samples (out of a list of over 6000 total samples screened) from geographically and ecologically diverse habitats according to the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) classification system (21,22).
index 4
data mVCs were identified using a computational approach described in Paez-Espino et al. (11). Briefly, a set of over 25 thousand viral protein families (VPFs) was constructed from manually identified mVCs and isolate viral genomes of dsDNA viruses and retroviruses available at NCBI (as of April 2015). This set of VPFs (accession link in Supplementary data) was used as bait for identifying viral sequences from assembled metagenomic contigs longer than 5 kb. In approximately a quarter of all mVCs the total gene coverage per contig by VPFs was very high (at least 70%) although, interestingly, in another quarter (representing ∼60 000 mVCs) the coverage was under 35%, indicating that a great volume of the viral gene content still remains unknown. In total, the 264 413 mVCs encode 6.1 million proteins, most of which (94.9%) had no hits to genes of known function at the time of the annotation.
index 5
data All viral sequences in IMG/VR are grouped into clusters of related sequences, ranging from 1 to 349 members per group. 122 665 sequences (46% of total) belong to single member clusters or singletons (represented with a ‘sg_’ prefix and a numeric identifier), while the remaining 145 655 sequences (143 532 mVCs and 2123 iVGs) were grouped into 39 701 viral clusters (represented with a ‘vc_’ prefix and a numeric identifier) of two members or more. From those, most groups (52%) have only two members while 4.5% have 10 or more members.
index 6
data This clustering approach employed in IMG/VR has been modified from the method previously used in Paez-Espino et al. (11), which relied on both amino acid identity and total alignment fraction for pairwise comparison of viral sequences, by a more scalable method based on nucleotide sequence identity (23,24). The stringent thresholds used (90% nucleotide sequence identity over 75% of the sequence length) made it possible to recreate the viral groups generated in Paez-Espino et al., recapitulating the species-level grouping for 87% of viral clusters, and with the remainder grouping at genus level.
index 7
data Traditionally, viruses infecting Bacteria or Archaea (i.e. phages) have been isolated from the host they have been infecting, and therefore the host–virus relation was delineated upfront (25). With the advent of metagenomics however, there is an increasing number of identification of viral sequences from environmental samples, for which the identification of a putative host is not as straight as it was for the isolate viruses. A number of computational methods have been proposed to bypass this limitation (11,26).
index 8
data IMG/VR provides putative host information for 20 073 viral sequences (7.5% of all the viral sequences) using two computational approaches as previously described (11). The first approach is looking for viral clusters that contain isolate viral genomes with host information. Projecting the isolate viral-host information onto the cluster results in host assignment for 862 mVCs. The second approach depends on the CRISPR-Cas prokaryotic immune system, which retains viral fragments (proto-spacers) within microbial CRISPR arrays (27,28,29). Using this approach, 13 474 mVCs were assigned to putative hosts.
index 9
data In total, genomes from 36 bacterial and archaeal phyla were linked to viral sequences (Table 1). A large number of these connections were previously unknown, including the identification of nine phyla (Atribacteria, Fervidibacteria, Armatimonadetes, Deferribacteres, Parcubacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Ignavibacteria, Aminicenantes and Saccharibacteria) which were not previously reported to be infected by viruses in the NCBI RefSeq database or as prophages (30).
index 10
data The search functionality in IMG/VR is similar to that in the IMG/M system (20). All isolate viral genomes (iVGs) can be accessed via ‘Quick Genome Search’ (by typing the virus name or taxon identifier (‘Taxon OID’)) or ‘Find Genomes’ tab (selecting viruses in ‘Genome Browser’ or ‘Genome Search’ tools) (Figure 1).
index 11
data The predicted mVCs are stored as metagenome scaffolds and they remain under their corresponding metagenome datasets (i.e. metagenome ‘Taxon OID’). Thus, metagenome ‘Taxon OIDs’ can also be accessed the same way that any iVG and specific mVCs can be retrieved from the ‘Scaffold Search’ tool of the ‘Find Genomes’ tab (Figure 1).
index 12
data In order to further facilitate the identification and selection of viral sequences in IMG/VR, all iVGs and mVCs can be accessed from the left panel table (IMG Viral Content) available from the entry page (Home tab) (Figure 2A). This entry point enables browsing all viral datasets in the context of their associated samples and corresponding metadata, e.g. habitat type or depth of the metagenome sample from which a viral sequence was identified (Figure 2B). This table provides information about the total number of viral contigs per sample in IMG, allowing a quick identification of the samples with the largest number of viruses. Similar to other tables in IMG, the results can be exported in a tab-delimited text format compatible with a number of other tools for metagenomic analysis, as well as R and Microsoft Excel (Figure 2B). By clicking on the ‘Viral Contig Count’ number from the previous table, users can examine the list of viral contigs from individual samples (Figure 2C). The information displayed for a selected contig or group of contigs includes: scaffold identifier (Scaffold ID), gene count per contig (Gene Count), contig length (Sequence Length bp), guanine and cytosine content (GC Content), percent of genes per contig covered with viral protein families (Perc VPFs), viral species name identifier (Viral Cluster; detailed in ‘Sequence grouping’ section and Supplementary data), predicted host and method of prediction (Host Detection; detailed in ‘Host–virus identification’ section), taxonomic assignment at different levels based on clusters of orthologous genes of phages (POGs) (Supplementary data), and the putative retrovirus sequences (Supplementary data).
index 13
data Metagenomic viral contigs can be viewed in relation to different environmental metadata associated with each sample. Two distinct curated environmental classifications systems are displayed at the bottom of the IMG/VR landing page, the ecosystem and the habitat type classification (11,21,22) (Figure 3).
index 14
data The ecosystem classification is based on a previously developed five-tier hierarchical classification system (21). All metagenome data sets are organized in three main classes of the top ecosystem tier: engineered, environmental and host-associated; and then further divided into sub-tiers called ecosystem category, ecosystem type, ecosystem subtype and specific ecosystem (31) (Figure 3A). Currently, 78.3% of the mVCs belong to environmental samples, while 16.3% and 5.4% correspond to host-associated and engineered, respectively. Users can navigate through all samples at once or just reduce the search to any specific ecosystem class or category (i.e ‘Environmental Terrestrial’ Figure 3B), and from there, select particular types, subtypes or specific ecosystems.
index 15
data The habitat type classification is based on 11 distinct manually curated habitat terms (e.g. air, freshwater, marine, host-associated human, host-associated plants, terrestrial soil) previously described (11). This classification allows the selection of mVCs from samples that belong to a single habitat type (Figure 3C).
index 16
data Viral contigs can be viewed based on the geographic coordinates of a corresponding sample. This functionality is available primarily for environmental metagenomes and allows the selection of samples with specific location via ‘Marker Clusterer for Google Maps’, a javascript API utility library that creates and manages per-zoom-level clusters for large amounts of markers. Ultimately, as users zoom in the map, a list of viral contigs that belong to a sample(s) can be retrieved -by clicking on a map pin- and selecting the count next to the metagenome of interest for that location (Figure 4A).
index 17
data Additionally, all viral contigs identified in samples from the human body can be displayed by clicking on the ‘Show Human Body Sites’ button (Figure 4B). This option allows access to viral contigs derived from samples of any of the five main human body sites (nose, mouth, skin, intestine, and vagina), together with general statistics of these viruses per body site (Figure 4C). From the default Human Body Sites summary table users can select all mVCs from a particular sample site or only those with a putative host (Figure 4D).
index 18
data Viral clusters and singletons together represent the entire viral diversity within IMG/VR. A total of 39 701 viral clusters and 122 665 singletons are available from the left panel on IMG/VR's entry page (Figure 5A). Together, these represent 162 366 viral quasi-species identified numerically with the prefix ‘vc_’ or ‘sg_’ depending if they belong to a viral cluster or remain as a singleton.
index 19
data By clicking on the viral cluster or singleton identifiers the users can obtain information about the number of members in the cluster (‘Viral Contig Count’), the number of samples in which they were found (‘Sample Count’), the number of independent projects these samples belong to (‘Study Count’), the proposed host (when detected, ‘Host’), and the sample's habitat (‘Habitat Type’) (Figure 5B).

data By clicking on a single viral cluster, all members of the cluster are displayed with several related metadata, including the number of genes per viral contig, contig length, GC content, host assignment, and taxonomic information (Figure 5C).
index 21
data The third section of the left panel in the IMG/VR entry page shows the number of viral contigs associated with a host. Three different categories of host-linked contigs are provided (Figure 6A). First, the number of isolate viruses experimentally assigned to a host is reported. There are currently 3929 such viruses, which when accessed, are listed together with their corresponding host (Figure 6B).
index 22
data Second, the metagenomic viral contigs that bear a proto-spacer sequence match to a spacer from a microbial isolate genome (allowing a direct association virus–host at the species level) are reported. There are currently 8084 mVCs which can be listed in a table grouped with their associated hosts. As an example, there are 131 different viral species (representing a total of 388 mVCs) putatively infecting Streptococcus oralis (Figure 6C).
index 23
data Finally, the total number of metagenomic viral sequences that can be assigned to a host (at the lowest possible taxonomic level) by projecting the host–virus information onto a viral cluster, is also presented. There are 13 947 in this category, whereby in the majority of the cases the virus-host link is at genus or species level. The microbial genera infected with the highest number of viral contigs are Streptococcus, Veillonella, Fusobacterium and Prevotella s (Figure 6D). In ∼9% of all assignments, the host connection is at a higher taxonomy range (ranging from family to phylum).
index 24
data All the information from all the tables can be independently accessed by clicking on their corresponding links or could be exported in a tab-delimited text format by using the ‘Export’ button.
index 25
data Users can compare their sequences against the sequence data integrated into IMG/VR. Specifically, the sequences of all the viral contigs and all the spacer sequences from the isolate genomes can be queried by using the ‘Viral/Spacer Blast’ option at the bottom of the home page (Figure 7A). Both queries can be selected from ‘Blast Database’ and rely on nucleotide BLAST searches (32) with customizable e-value cutoffs (Figure 7B).
index 26
data Matches against the viral database generate a list of viral sequences with a significant alignment based on the selected thresholds. These subject sequences can be directly accessed or selected to-be-added to the Scaffold Cart, where their associated metadata are also provided. Similarly, matches of external viral sequences against the spacer database generate a list of host(s) containing a CRISPR-spacer sequence with a significant alignment based on the selected cutoffs. These putative host(s) can be further explored by clicking on the host identifier. This redirects the user to detailed information of the spacer: source taxon name, location of the spacer within the CRISPR array, and spacer sequence (Figure 7C).
index 27
data We present the first version of a viral specific system within the IMG database. Almost 6000 metagenome datasets publicly available in IMG/M were mined in search of viral contigs at the time of the study (June 2016). Since IMG/M is continuously growing in number and size of metagenome studies, we anticipate that the number of viral sequences included in IMG/VR will continue to grow rapidly. Future versions of IMG/VR will complement the isolate and metagenomic viral contigs detected with prophage sequences identified from microbial genomes. This is expected to drive the identification of a larger number of virus-host connections and the viral clusters expansion connected to hosts. In addition, we are developing an RNA virus discovery pipeline from metatrascriptomic datasets that will complement the global DNA virome. We also plan to expand the current host–virus assignment with other prediction approaches (e.g. based on viral tRNA matches (11), specific lysozymes, or other computational approaches (12,26)) and to refine viral taxonomy in accordance with community standards that should be derived from the gene sharing networks emerging as a way to organize the viral sequence space, expanding the current information about eukaryotic and archaeal viruses as well as putative giant viruses and virophages.
index 28
data Overall, the growing number of metagenomic datasets and the continuous detection of new viral contigs together with the ongoing development of analysis and search capabilities within the IMG system will render IMG/VR a critical community resource for the study of viruses.

data Mammalian cells express pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and are therefore able to detect microbes. The PRRs are activated upon binding to conserved molecular structures, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), to induce expression of antiviral and proinflammatory proteins.1, 2 The fact that most PAMPs are expressed only by microbes and not by host cells, allows the innate immune system to respond specifically to non-self. In addition to pathogen-specific PAMPs, DNA is a potent stimulator of antimicrobial responses.1, 3 To discriminate between DNA derived from the microbes versus the host, DNA sensors are present in the cytosol, as well as in endosomal membrane structures, that is, compartments expected to be free of host DNA.
index 0
data Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 was the first DNA sensor to be described. It is expressed in the endosomal membrane and monitors the endosomal content for unmethylated, CpG-rich DNA.4 As host DNA is mostly methylated, and hence has a low CpG content, as opposed to microbial DNA, TLR9 detects foreign DNA based both on location and chemical composition of the DNA. TLR9 signals through the adaptor protein MyD88, resulting in activation of signaling pathways eventually leading to activation of the transcription factors interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 7- and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), which in turn drive transcription of type I IFN subtypes and proinflammatory cytokines2 (Figure 1).
index 1
data As TLR9 is expressed by only a limited number of cell types, most notably plasmacytoid dendritic cells,5, 6 this receptor is not the central sensor of viruses in the cells most often infected by viruses. RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) recognize RNA species in the cytosol and include RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2. Both RIG-I and MDA5 bind double-stranded RNA, but RIG-I preferentially recognizes shorter fragments while long RNA molecules activates MDA5.7 Furthermore, to distinguish between host and pathogen RNA, RIG-I senses 5′-triphosphate containing RNA, a structure often formed in viral RNA.8, 9 RIG-I and MDA5 both contain two caspase activation and recruitment domains, which upon ligand recognition engage in homotypic interaction with the adaptor protein mitochondrial activator of virus signaling (MAVS) leading to activation of Tank-binding kinase (TBK) 1, and IκB kinase α and β, culminating in the expression of type I IFN as well as proinflammatory proteins.10, 11, 12, 13
index 2
data Recently, attention has been drawn towards cytosolic PRRs sensing DNA. Several receptors have been proposed to be important for cytosolic DNA recognition, including absent in melanoma (AIM2), gamma-interferon-inducible protein (IFI16) and cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)1, 2 (Table 1). Upon DNA binding, AIM2 initiates the assembly of the inflammasome, a complex that includes the adaptor protein ASC and caspase 1. The activated inflammasome cleaves the proforms of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 to generate bioactive cytokines.14, 15 The PYHIN protein, IFI16 and the nucleotidyltransferase, cGAS both bind DNA, mainly independent of the DNA sequence, with exceptions as described below. Signaling through cGAS or IFI16 depends on the adaptor molecule stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as MITA, MPYS, ERIS and TMEM173), which is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in non-activated cells.2, 16 Upon DNA binding, cGAS undergoes a conformational change, leading to activation of the enzyme and synthesis of the second messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (2′3′-cGAMP) from ATP and GTP, which is a ligand for STING. Many bacteria, including the intracellular bacteria Listeria monocytogenes,17 also produce cyclic dinucleotides (CDN), but they contain a conventional 3′5′ linkages. These cyclic dinucleotides activate a pro-bacterial type I IFN response in mice but not humans through a STING-dependent pathway.18, 19, 20 Importantly, the cGAS-produced 2′3′-cGAMP is a highly potent stimulator of both murine and human STING.21, 22 cGAMP binds in a pocket at the interface of the two STING protomers, resulting in translocation of STING from the ER compartment to perinuclear autophagy-like vesicles.22, 23 The translocation route of STING has been less defined, however recent results determine a translocation through the ER–Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC) and the Golgi apparatus with the activation of downstream signaling molecules taking place at or before the ERGIC.24 TBK1 is autophosphorylated and recruited to STING, allowing the phosphorylation of STING. Interestingly, the phosphorylated residue of STING has been shown to localize in a serine cluster, which is evolutionary conserved in other adaptor molecules, including MAVS and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF). The phosphorylation of STING allows the transcription factor IRF3 to dock to the phosphorylated residue, resulting in TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3 leading to dimerization, nuclear translocation and activation, eventually turning on the transcription of type I IFN genes.25, 26
index 3
data IFI16 is predominantly nuclear, but a small pool of IFI16 is cytoplasmic and has been demonstrated to co-localize with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 genomic DNA in the cytoplasm upon infection.27 IFI16 binds the DNA via two HIN domains, allowing the formation of filamentous oligomers on the DNA molecule, which is thought to facilitate signaling through STING and the induction of type I IFN.27, 28, 29 One study has shown IFI16 to have higher affinity for longer, naked DNA fragments (>150 bp) than short fragments. As nuclear self-DNA is bound by histones, the IFI16 affinity for longer DNA fragments could potentially represent a mechanism to discriminate between self- and non-self DNA.29 At present it is not explained how IFI16 mediates signaling, although there are papers to suggest that IFI16 and cGAS act in the same pathway.30, 31
index 4
data Experimental in vivo work in mice has demonstrated the importance of AIM2 in the early control of murine cytomegalovirus (CMV) after intraperitoneal infection, acting through a mechanism dependent on induction of IL-18 and stimulation of type II IFN production by natural killer cells.32 Likewise, cGAS is essential for control of infections with HSV-1 (intravenous infection), murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) (intraperitoneal infection), and vaccinia virus (intranasal infection), and this is believed to be dependent on induction of type I IFN.33, 34
index 5
data STING−/− mice were found to display elevated mortality rate after intravenous HSV-1 infection compared with wild-type mice, and the virus replicated more efficiently in the brain of STING-deficient mice. Importantly, these signs correlated with no detectable type I IFN in the blood of infected STING-deficient animals.23 In agreement with this, HSV-1 did not induce detectable levels of type I IFN in STING−/− MEF cells and bone-marrow-derived macrophages.23 Interestingly, this phenotype was largely identical in cGAS−/− mice after HSV-1 infection through the same route, suggesting that potential alternative functions of these proteins are not central in host defense against HSV-1.34
index 6
data The cytosolic DNA sensors IFI16 and cGAS are activated in cells infected with DNA viruses.1 Studies with different DNA viruses, including HSV-1 and CMV, have shown that viral genomic DNA associates with the DNA sensor IFI16, thus suggesting the foreign incoming genome to stimulate the DNA sensing machinery.27, 35, 36 It has been demonstrated that viral genomic DNA is released into the cytosol upon infection, and this is preceded by K48-linked ubiquitination of capsid associated factors and subsequent proteosomal degradation of the viral capsid27, 37 (Figure 2). Such studies suggest the viral genome to be the trigger of DNA-dependent immune responses. Other studies suggest that virus-induced cellular stress triggers release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol, which in turn activates the cGAS-STING pathway. Herpesviruses are reported to induce mitochondrial stress and through this mitochondrial DNA pathway stimulate cGAS activation.38 The relative contribution of the different sources of DNA for the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway during viral infections remains to be characterized in details.
index 7
data Retrovirus replication leads to accumulation of several DNA-containing nucleic acid structures with the capacity to stimulate DNA sensors.39 Whereas the RNA:DNA intermediate has been reported to be detected by TLR9 and cGAS,40, 41 the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) species and the final double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) products also have the potential to stimulate type I IFN expression in a manner dependent on IFI16 and cGAS.30, 42 Viral ssDNA molecules named ‘strong-stop (−)-strand DNA' (sstDNA) are present in the cytosol upon HIV-1 infection.43 These sstDNAs, formed by the first 181 nucleotides of the HIV-1 genome, are reversely transcribed and fold up in a secondary structure with three hairpin elements. This structure has recently been reported as a HIV-1 PAMP, stimulating type I IFN production, due to sensing by cGAS.44 Herzner et al.44 found that the transition from dsDNA to ssDNA, named Y-form DNA, was the stimulatory part of the sstDNA molecule. The Y-form structure stimulates the production of cGAMP and the cGAMP response was found to correlate with the numbers of guanosine nucleotides in the Y-form structure. Jakobsen et al.30 have further shown that sensing of the stem-loop structures of lentiviral ssDNA molecules, including sstDNA is dependent on IFI16 and STING.
index 8
data Beyond DNA recognition in the infected cells, there are now emerging evidence to support that cGAMP propagates signals to adjacent non-infected cells, hence spreading antiviral activity. First, it was reported that cGAMP can diffuse to neighboring cells through gap junctions to stimulate STING-dependent type I IFN expression.45 Second, cGAMP has been shown to be packed in viral particles. Two papers by Bridgeman et al. and Gentili et al.,46, 47 detected cGAMP in Vaccinia virus and murine CMV virions as well as in lentivector-derived lentivirus particles. cGAMP-containing virus particles stimulated cGAS−/− STING+/+ cell lines to produce type I IFN and the particles were further able to activate dendritic cells. At present it is not known whether cGAMP is actively packed into the viral particles as an antiviral strategy to allow early type I IFN responses in infected cells and in cells with low cGAS expression, or whether cGAMP is randomly taken up together with cytosolic material as the virus particle maturates and are released from the host cell. A third possibility is that some viruses actively incorporate cGAMP, as low levels of type I IFN might influence the infection positively. Studies of MHV68 have shown the establishment of latency to be IFN dependent and IFN was furthermore shown important for the inhibition of acute cell damages resulting from uncontrolled virus replication.48
index 9
data The family of herpesviruses has been reported to evade the DNA sensing machinery both at the level of sensing, and signaling through the STING-TBK1-dependent pathway. We previously identified a conserved herpesvirus deubiquitinase to inhibit STING-dependent DNA signaling in macrophages.49 Mechanistically, this occurred upstream of DNA release into the cytosol, thus suggesting the deubiquitinase to prevent the viral DNA to become accessible for DNA sensors (Figure 3).The infected cell protein (ICP)0 protein encoded by HSV-1 possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity through the RING finger domain. The ubiquitination activity and an active proteasomal pathway was reported to be crucial for the establishment of lytic infection in HSV-1 infected cells.50, 51 Orzalli et al.35 reported ICP0 to trigger the degradation of IFI16 by the proteasome resulting in impaired sensing of HSV-1 and reduced production of IFN-stimulated genes. However, ICP0 also has functions independent of the E3 ligase activity. For instance, ICP0 was found to inhibit IRF3 in the nucleus of epithelial cells co-infected with HSV-1 and Sendai virus.52 This was due to sequestration of IRF-3 in ICP0-containing foci in the nucleus, thus resulting in a dislocation of the transcription factor away from the promoter target elements.35
index 10
data Another herpesvirus protein known to target IFI16 is pUL83, a tegument protein of human CMV (HCMV). pUL83 is the most abundant protein in the HCMV particle and the protein localizes to the nucleus early during infection.53, 54 pUL83 was first shown to interact with nuclear IFI16 to stimulate IFI16-dependent transcription from the major immediate-early promoter of HCMV.55 In a follow-up work by Li et al.,36 pUL83 was reported to inhibit the oligomerization of activated, nuclear IFI16 and hence to block the signal transmission from IFI16 to STING resulting in diminished type I IFN expression. The work showed pUL83 to interact directly with the Pyrin domain of IFI16, with inhibitory effects. The Pyrin domain has been reported to be essential for cooperative assembly of IFI16 filaments on dsDNA,29 which is likely to be a requirement for IFI16-mediated DNA dependent signaling. The results on ICP0 and pUL83 underline that IFI16 takes part in sensing of herpesvirus genomes and activates a STING-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway. Despite this, there is currently no mechanistic understanding of how IFI16 mediates activation of the STING pathway.
index 11
data cGAS is well established to be a DNA sensor, and unlike the case for IFI16, there is mechanistic understanding of how cGAS links to STING-dependent signaling, through production of the second messenger cGAMP as described above.56, 57 The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) protein ORF52 was recently identified to inhibit the enzymatic activity of cGAS. ORF52 is like HCMV pUL83 a tegument protein, but contrary to the nuclear localization of pUL83, ORF52 is only found in the cytosol and in perinuclear regions.58 ORF52 was reported to be a DNA-binding protein and the ability to sequester stimulatory DNA was shown to be important, but not sufficient for the KSHV-dependent inhibition of type I IFN. This observation was explained by cGAS binding to DNA occurring with higher affinity than DNA binding by ORF52. To complete the inhibition of cGAS, ORF52 is also able to bind cGAS directly.59 The ORF52 homologs of three other gammaherpesviruses, namely Epstein-Barr virus, MHV68 and Rhesus monkey rhadinovirus are also able to bind cytosolic DNA and thus inhibit the enzymatic activity of cGAS, indicating that the cGAS target is evolutionary conserved in gammaherpesviruses. An ORF52-like protein encoded by an alphaherpesvirus, with a cGAS inhibitory function has not been reported. However, it has been speculated that the tegument protein VP22 from HSV-1 binds cGAS, as VP22 and ORF52 have some three dimensional structurally homology,59, 60 but functionally evidence is still lacking.
index 12
data Herpesvirus genomes are recognized by several DNA receptors, which share the feature that they utilize the adaptor protein STING for downstream signaling.27, 34 Consequently, to ensure a broad inhibition of Herpesvirus-induced type I IFN, targeting of STING as well as the STING interaction partner, TBK1 would be an efficient means to block early antiviral defense.
index 13
data Recently, a study aiming to identify novel KSHV-encoded proteins targeting DNA sensing pathways, reported that the viral IRF1 (vIRF1), interacted directly with STING, at a time point after STING trafficking from the ER. This interaction impedes the binding of TBK1 to STING, thus inhibiting phosphorylation and activation of STING, TBK1 and IRF3.61 Consequently, vIRF1 was found to be able to inhibit the induction of type I IFN production. An additional role for vIRF1 in evasion of KSHV-induced IFN production has also been reported to occur through interaction between vIRF1 and the transcriptionally coactivators CBP/p300. The interaction impairs the association between CBP/p300 and IRF3 resulting in inefficient transcription from IRF3-dependent promoters.62
index 14
data Several herpesvirus proteins are reported to target TBK1 as a viral strategy to inhibit the DNA sensing pathway further downstream in the pathway. ICP34.5 from HSV-1 and ORF11 from MHV68 both bind directly to TBK1, resulting in decreased IRF3 activation and type I IFN expression.63, 64 The KSHV protein ORF45 uses an alternative mechanism to inhibit TBK1-dependent type I IFN expression. ORF45 do not inactivate TBK1, but acts instead as an alternative substrate for TBK1. In a HEK293T cell system, ORF45 was found to interact with non-phosphorylated IRF7 and as ORF45 in this context is a preferred substrate for TBK1 compared with IRF7, ORF45 is phosphorylated on two serine residues in a TBK1-dependent manner whereas IRF7 remains non-phosphorylated and thus inactive.65 This mechanism does not affect IRF3 activation but leads to decreased type I IFN expression, given the well-described role for IRF7 in the IFN-positive feedback loop.66, 67
index 15
data Although most information on evasion of DNA-stimulated signaling has been obtained from studies on herpesviruses, there is also accumulating evidence for other viruses targeting these pathways. For instance the Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase interacts with STING, and inhibits production of type I IFNs.68 The interaction between the two proteins prompted degradation of STING. Interestingly, the pool of STING that was degraded was ubiquitinated through K63-linked chains, a process which has been reported to be mediated by several E3 ubiquitin ligases and to be essential for activation of the pathway.1 Thus, the Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase targets selectively the pool of activated STING.
index 16
data Several DNA oncoviruses express proteins that target the Leu-X-Cys-X-Glu (LXCXE) binding site in the retinoblastoma protein, thus contributing to the oncogenic properties of these viruses.69 Additionally, the LXCXE motif was recently found to be important in the inhibition of the DNA sensing pathway by oncogenic viruses. The E7 protein from human papillomavirus and E1A from adenovirus were both identified as suppressors of the cGAS-STING pathway.70 Interestingly, the LXCXE motif was reported to bind STING and inhibit downstream signaling. As many cell lines are immortalized with LXCXE-containing tumor proteins, the DNA sensing pathway of these cell lines is permanently impaired. Thus Lau et al.70 showed that knock out of E1A and E7 increased the potential to mount type I IFN responses to dsDNA in these cell lines. LXCXE-containing proteins are expressed by different ssDNA and dsDNA viruses and potently bind the retinoblastoma protein, thus mediating cell proliferation and oncogenesis.71 Lau et al. speculated that the LXCXE motifs evolved in these viruses to inhibit STING and hence to facilitate the establishment of infection, and that the oncogenic function of the LXCXE motif may be a secondary effect. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that only a minor group of viruses expressing LXCXE-containing proteins have oncogenic properties.70
index 17
data HIV-1 replicates efficiently in human macrophages, and this replication stimulates only modest innate immune responses.30, 72 Upon cell entry the viral capsid plays an important role in preventing immediate recognition of the viral genome. More host proteins, including the cofactors cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6) and cyclophilin A (CypA), are known to be recruited to the viral capsid to facilitate virus replication in myeloid cells.73, 74, 75 The recruitment of CPSF6 to the capsid explains the ability of the pharmaceutical molecule PF-3450074 to block HIV-1 replication. PF-3450074 competes with CPSF6 for binding to the HIV-1 capsid, thus blocking virus replication.76, 77
index 18
data Findings by Rasaiyaah et al.72 showed that the recruitment of specific host proteins to the HIV-1 capsid is necessary for preventing premature DNA synthesis and stimulation of innate DNA receptors. Myeloid cells stimulated with a capsid mutant (P90A) with impaired CypA interaction, produced cGAMP through a mechanism dependent on the reverse transcriptase. This result shows that the HIV-1 genome is recognized by cGAS in cases with non-intact capsids. Hence HIV-1 has evolved a defense against cytosolic detectors, relying on the cloaking of a replication intermediate by the host factors CPSF6 and CypA.
index 19
data As described above the retroviral replication intermediates, ssDNA, Y-form DNA, RNA:DNA hybrids and dsDNA are recognized by cGAS as well as by IFI16. It is thus conceivable that retroviruses have evolved different mechanisms for inhibition of the DNA sensing pathway. HIV-1 is known to target the RLR pathway via a relocalization of RIG-I to lysosomes and perinuclear compartments through a mechanism dependent on the viral protease,78 but knowledge about inhibition of the DNA sensing pathway is still insufficient. Recently, the two HIV-1 proteins Vpr and Vif were reported to target and inactivate TBK1 in dendritic- and macrophage-like cells.79 TBK1 was found to be ubiquitinated, as a normal response to TRAF3 activation, but the subsequent autophosphorylation of TBK1 was lacking due to Vpr and Vif expression. Vpr and Vif were found to interact with TBK1 and as both proteins are present in the incoming virus particle, it is possible that HIV-1 inhibits DNA receptor-dependent signaling at early time points post-viral entry.79
index 20
data In addition to DNA viruses, several viruses carrying single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genomes have been reported to modulate STING and downstream signaling. Although this seems counterintuitive, published data describing different cellular mechanisms, provide a rationale for why some RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to inhibit STING. First, RIG-I has been shown to interact with STING in a manner dependent on MAVS following activation by positive ssRNA viruses, thus amplifying the IFN production.80 Second, Schoggins et al.33 found lower basal expression of IFN-stimulated genes in cGAS−/− mice, and proposed that low-grade constitutive activation of this pathway sets the immunological tone in the organism. In support of this, cGAS−/− mice showed higher mortality compared with wild-type mice upon infection with the positive sense ssRNA virus West Nile virus. Finally, we identified that the virus cell membrane fusion induces induction of type I IFN expression in a STING-dependent but cGAS-independent manner.81 Using virus-like particles from HSV-1 lacking capsid and genomes as well as fusogenic cationic liposomes, we showed an induction of type I IFNs upon membrane fusion.81
index 21
data Coronaviruses are a big group of enveloped ssRNA with a positive sense genome. The swine virus Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, infecting epithelial cells of the intestine, encodes a protease and deubiquitinase protein, named Papain-like protease 2 (PLP2). In addition to targeting RIG-I, PLP2 is able to interact directly with STING and reduce the ubiquitination status of the protein, resulting in reduced STING-dependent IFN expressions.82 The STING-targeting mechanism is thought to be conserved in PLP-expressing coronaviruses, as PLP2-like proteins from human coronavirus (NL63) and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (PLpro) respectively, both antagonize STING in a similar manner.83
index 22
data The protease NS2B3 from dengue virus is another STING targeting protein, with specific affinity for the human form of STING. The virus is enveloped with a non-segmented positive sense ssRNA genome, which normally induces low type I IFN levels, indicating an inhibitory evasion mechanism. The virus replication was shown to be more efficient in STING-depleted cells and this phenotype was explained by a protease-dependent cleavage of STING. The viral protease NS2B3 was found to interact with and cleave STING N-terminally, at the sequence LRRG. The LRRG sequence is not conserved in mice, and this lack of NS2B3 recognition sequence explains partly why the murine STING is not degraded by NS2B3. In addition to LRRG other regions in the STING molecule are necessary for efficient targeting by NS2B3, as a mutant form of murine STING, expressing the human LRRG sequence was still resistant to NS2B3-dependent cleavage.84, 85
index 23
data Finally, we have recently reported that the fusion peptide of the influenza A virus HA protein interacts with STING in a specific region localized close to the dimerization interphase of STING, and this prevents the dimerization of STING and downstream IFN production in response to membrane fusion but not cGAMP stimulation.86 To our knowledge, Influenza A virus is the first example of a negative sense RNA virus, harboring a STING evasion mechanism. Collectively, STING dependent signaling pathways are also active during infection with RNA viruses. Therefore, this class of viruses has evolved means to dampen signaling by STING.
index 24
data DNA is a highly immunostimulatory molecule, and the immune responses evoked by DNA have antiviral activity. Consequently microbes with DNA genomes have evolved mechanisms to evade sensing and signaling through the pathways stimulated by DNA. This is probably of central importance for the ability of DNA viruses to establish infection, and underscores the importance of the DNA-stimulated immune pathways in protective immunity.
index 25
data With the accumulating insight into the mechanisms of viral evasion of DNA sensing, there is now a need to understand the importance of these mechanisms in vivo. Further knowledge on the cellular targets and mechanisms of action of viral strategies to evade the DNA sensing machinery will lead to better understanding of the pathogenesis of viral diseases, and could also uncover potential targets for future immunomodulatory drugs.

respiratory problems, such as nasal discharge, cough and evidence of bronchopneumonia, were
included, whereas those that revealed secondary respiratory disease caused by cardiovascular

data Viral nucleic acid extraction, quantification and reverse transcription:
Viral nucleic acid from the positive controls and specimens was extracted using the Viral
Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit II (GeneAid, Taipei, Taiwan) according to manufacturer’s

used for CAdV-2 (E3 gene), CDV (NP gene), CIV (M gene), CPIV (NP gene), CRCoV (S gene) and
CaHV-1 (GB gene) amplification were retrieved from previous studies [4, 6, 14, 16] and are shown in Table 1. In order to ascertain the sensitivity, specificity and interaction of those
primers, more than 45 sequences of each target gene were compared by multiple alignments
using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor Version 7.1.3.0 (Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA,
U.S.A.). The in silico specificity test was performed to select the
conserved regions using BLASTn analysis in order to ensure the primer specificity without
cross amplification of canine genes. Degenerate primers for CIV, CDV, CAdV-2 and CRCoV were
applied (Table 1). Moreover, the canine
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as an internal control as
reported previously [20].
index 4
data Optimization of the simplex PCR: Prior to performing the PCR for detection
of RNA viruses, a first round PCR for CRCoV was performed in order to increase the detection
sensitivity. Reactions were comprised of a mixture of 2x GoTaq® Hot Start Green
Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.), 0.4 µM final concentration of
each outer primer (CoV_16053_F and CoV_16594_R) and 2 µl of cDNA, and made
up to 25 µl with nuclease-free water. Reactions were performed using 3Prime
G Gradient Thermal Cycle (Techne, Bristol, U.K.). Cycling conditions were comprised of an
initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for
30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec. The final extension was performed at 72°C for 7 min.
Subsequently, the amplified CRCoV product of the first round PCR, and cDNA of the other RNA
viruses (CIV, CPIV and CDV) and extracted DNA viruses (CAdV-2 and CaHV-1) were used as a
template for further simplex PCR studies.
index 5
data Gradient simplex PCR was performed for each virus. All reaction compositions were as
mentioned above, but the gradient annealing temperature (Ta) was programmed ranging from
50°C to 59°C in order to optimize the reaction. Thermal cycling was performed with 95°C for
5 min, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, varied Ta for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, and then
finally 72°C for 10 min. The amplicons were resolved by 2% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis
with 10% ethidium bromide in-gel staining and visualized by UV transillumination and
compared to expected size of the PCR product (Table
1).
index 6
data Optimizations of multiplex PCR: The multiplex PCR was optimized separately
for RNA- and DNA-associated CIRDC viruses. The starting genetic material for RNA virus
detection was derived from two compartments: (1) product from the first nested PCR of CRCoV
and (2) cDNA of the other RNA viruses. Reaction composition and condition were optimized as
mentioned above for the simplex PCR. The suitable Ta for all RNA and DNA viruses was
selected for further comparative analysis with simplex PCR.
index 7
data Sequencing of PCR amplicons was performed to confirm their correct identity and thus the
specificity of the PCR reaction. Amplicons were purified with a NucleoSpin Extract II
(Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) kit and submitted to The 1st BASE, Pte. Ltd. (Singapore)
for direct sequencing. The derived nucleotide sequences were aligned using the BioEdit
Sequence Alignment Editor version 7.0.9.0 software, and the respective consensus sequences
were compared to those in the GenBank database using BLASTn analysis.
index 8
data Analysis of Specificity, Sensitivity and Reproducibility
index 9
data Specificity test: The analytical specificity of each simplex PCR assay was
evaluated by cross-reaction tests with various CIRDC-associated viruses, as well as canine
parvovirus (CPV), canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV) and Bordetella
bronchiseptica.
index 10
data Sensitivity test: To access the analytical sensitivity of each simplex PCR
assay, two-fold serial dilutions of nucleic extracted positive controls were amplified. The
ten dilutions of tested controls were 20 –2−10ng/ PCR
reaction.
index 11
data Reproducibility: Both intra- and inter-assay variations were measured
using the positive controls and sequenced clinical samples. To assess the intra-assay
variation, triplicate amplifications of the 2−10 and
20ng/reaction templates for the positive controls and the
samples were performed in a single multiplex PCR assay. To evaluate the inter-assay
variation, the above single multiplex PCR was performed as three independent multiplex PCR
assays.
index 12
data Diagnostic performance of the multiplex PCR: To evaluate the reliability
of the developed multiplex PCR for clinical testing, the performance of the assay was
compared to those of the simplex PCR and a commercial test kit (Antigen Rapid CIRD-3 Ag test
kit, Bionote, Hwaseong, South Korea). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value and negative predictive value were determined. Independent t-test was
used to evaluate the difference between route of sample collection and number of viral
detection using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., New York, NY, U.S.A.)
index 13
data Study population: The 51 dogs with respiratory clinical illness included
in this study were 29 males and 22 females. Most of the dogs were puppies (37.3%) or senile
(23.5%). Most presented with a nasal discharge (80.4%), coughing (47.1%), loss of appetite
(56.9%) and bronchopneumonia (41.2%). Only 29.4% (15/51) of dogs were vaccinated.
index 14
data Optimized and analytical performances of simplex and multiplex PCR assays:
Optimization of each simplex PCR was undertaken using positive controls and clinical samples
with different cycling conditions. Different annealing temperatures were evaluated, with the
optimum Ta for all virus detections being 58°C, at which temperature no primer dimers or
non-specific amplicons were detected (data not shown). In silico and
in vitro analytical specificity tests revealed that each primer was able
to amplify the specific target DNA without any cross amplification among the CIRDC viruses,
CPV, CCoV and B. bronchiseptica. In addition, the sequenced amplicons
showed 100% sequence identity with their respective corresponding sequence in the GenBank
database.
index 15
data Analytical sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility: The sensitivity
of the multiplex PCR was tested by detection of the various viruses in serial dilutions and
compared with that using the simplex PCR for each particular virus. The multiplex PCR
products of the tested viruses were observed at the same template dilutions as with the
simplex PCR, suggesting a similar sensitivity for the simplex and multiplex PCRs (Figs. 1 and 2). The highest detection threshold was found for CDV and CRCoV, then CaHV-1 and CIV,
and finally by CPIV and CAdV-2.
index 16
data The specificity of the tested PCRs was evaluated by using other pathogens as mentioned
above. No specific amplicons were detected in all reactions. For evaluation of the
reproducibility, both intra- and inter-assay variations revealed similar results among the
assays (data not shown).
index 17
data Evaluation of the multiplex PCR using clinical specimens: The multiplex
PCRs were tested on the 51 NS and 51 OS samples (Fig.
3) and compared with the simplex PCR assays for each respective virus (Table 2). The CAdV-2 and CRCoV detection had 100% sensitivity and specificity for both
the NS and OS sampling sites. False negative results were observed in CaHV-1, CIV, CPIV and
CDV detection when performing multiplex PCRs, which resulted in a lower sensitivity of
87.5–97.7%. The PPV (100%) of all multiplex PCRs was consistent with the specificity (100%),
while the NPV (89.5–99.0%) of those reactions was contrary with their sensitivity. Neither
the multiplex RT-PCR nor the multiplex PCR showed false positive results when compared with
its simplex counterpart.
index 18
data The comparison between the multiplex PCRs and the rapid three-antigen test kit (CAdV-2, CIV
and CDV) was performed on the same samples (Table
3). With the clinical samples tested in this study, the rapid test kit yielded
100% sensitivity and a relatively high specificity for CAdV-2 and CDV. However, for CIV,
there were high numbers of PCR-positive samples detected by multiplex PCR (83/102), whereas
the test kits showed negative results.
index 19
data Detection of CIRDC viruses in clinical samples by multiplex PCR: In single
infection CIV was the predominant virus detected and accounted for 23.5% (12/51) and 19.6%
(10/51) positive NS and OS samples, respectively. The next most common virus was CPIV,
detected at 3.9% (2/51) and 5.8% (3/51) of NS and OS samples, respectively, with 2% (1/51)
being positive for CRCoV infection in both NS and OS samples. Even though the CDV, CAdV-2
and CaHV-1 were not detected as a single infection, they were detected in multiple
infections in these tested samples (Table
4).
index 20
data For dual infections, the most frequently detected viruses were CIV co-infected with CRCoV
at 13.7% and 21.6% in NS and OS, respectively, followed by CIV with CPIV at 9.8% and 7.8% in
NS and OS samples, respectively. For triple infections, CIV and CRCoV were frequently found
together co-infected with other viruses, and especially with CDV and CPIV. However, one dog
was negative for all tested viruses in both the NS and OS samples.
index 21
data Generally, dual infections were predominant in CIRDC suffering dogs (42.2%), followed by
single (28.4%) and triple (22.6%) infections. With regards to the sampling site, the
frequency of positive results was not statistically different between the OS and NS sampling
sites (P>0.05).
index 22
data The CIRDC is an important disease that impacts on dogs, especially puppies or
immunosuppressed dogs, and is frequently associated with viral infections. It has gained
attention recently, because many viruses have been discovered and co-infections with
multiple pathogens are often fatal. Thus, the development of diagnostic tools for
CIRDC-associated virus detection is necessary to enhance the diagnosis coverage. In this
study, multiplex RT-PCR and multiplex PCR for the detection of CIRDC-associated RNA and DNA
viruses, respectively, were developed and compared with conventional methods. Both developed
multiplex PCRs could detect several viruses associated with CIRDC efficiently. The two
multiplex PCRs gave similar results equivalent to that obtained from the conventional
simplex PCRs that could only detect one pathogen per reaction and so required six separate
reactions per sample. Nested amplification was performed for CRCoV detection in order to
increase the sensitivity of detection (Poovorawan, personal communication). Although
multiplex PCR has been developed previously to detect several pathogens of CIRDC, such as
CIV, CDV and CRCoV [10], its application remained
limited because of the narrow range of viruses covered, with other CIRDC-associated viruses
being neither detected nor ruled out. Thus, our study might provide a novel platform for
whole CIRDC-virus detection.
index 23
data The overall sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR and multiplex PCR was more than 90% and
87%, respectively, compared to their simplex counterparts. However, the detection of CRCoV
was modified as a hemi-nested RT-PCR to increase its sensitivity. The false negative
reactions when performing multiplex PCRs in this study might be resulted from the selection
of the single optimized Ta for several primer pairs and the low amount of particular target
genes [1]. These suggested for the decreased
sensitivity of the developed multiplex PCRs. Moreover, there was 100% specificity in both
modalities for clinical sample detection. Thus, these platforms could likely be used
effectively in practice. Recently, some multiplex PCR assays were developed in order to
detect the CIRDC pathogens [10]; however, the test
might be immature, because only CIV, CDV and CRCoV could be detected but not for others.
Thus, our study expanded the coverage of CIRDC virus detection. In an evaluation of the
commercially available three-antigen rapid test kit (CAdV-2, CIV and CDV), we found only CIV
detection showed an unexpected sensitivity and specificity. A previous study reported that
the developed multiplex RT-PCR for H3N2 CIV, CDV and CRCoV detection had an almost 100%
sensitivity and specificity compared with the conventional RT-PCR and rapid antigen test kit
[10]. In contrast, our study showed that the
CIV-positive samples by multiplex RT-PCR were negative when tested with the rapid antigen
test kit. This is consistent with reports that many rapid test kits might have a low
sensitivity to detect the influenza virus, but could still be suitable for rapid in-house
clinical applications [11, 15]. This reflects that the type of kit, viral copy number, duration of
storage, route of sample collection, and type or virus strain may all influence the test
results [19]. Interestingly, in this study, about 70%
(71/102) of samples from the clinical respiratory illness dogs were found to have multiple
infections. This finding supports that symptomatically, the CIRDC is a complex disease,
which is mostly caused by co-infection with more than one pathogen. Recently, Jeoung
et al. (2013) used both NS and whole blood samples for CIRDC virus
detection, but found that only CDV (and not CIV and CRCoV) could be detected from the whole
blood samples [10]. Correspondingly, respiratory
swabs have been reported to be appropriate samples for the detection of respiratory
pathogens [9, 16]. Thus, NS and OS served as appropriate sample sources in our study due to
their ease of and non-invasive sampling nature and that they lie on the viral shedding
routes. This study also suggested that the virus should be screened for in NS and OS, with
detection levels at each site depending on the type of virus. The CAdV-2 and CaHV-1 mostly
replicate in the lower respiratory tracts and shed via respiratory discharge, consisting
with our finding that they were mostly detected in the OS, even though NS could often detect
these viruses as well. However, the CAdV-2 primer pair used in this study was able to
amplify CAdV-1 DNA virus which also shows airborne transmission and replicates in tonsil
[3]. Therefore, the positive PCR reaction for canine
adenovirus could not discriminate between CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 in this study. Additionally,
CaHV-1 can be latent in various nerve ganglions, resulting in negative results from nucleic
acid-based CaHV-1 detection in respiratory discharges in non-symptomatic dogs [12].
index 24
data In this study, 3 out of 15 vaccinated dogs receiving, at least once, combined vaccine
against CPIV, CDV and CAdV-2 showed PCR positive results for CIRDC virus detection (2 CDV
positive dogs and 1 CPIV positive dog). Even though live attenuated vaccines can give false
positive results with molecular testing, it is essential to discriminate between wild-type
infection and recent vaccination for the prevention of false positivity in the future.
index 25
data This study documented CaHV-1 and CRCoV circulation in Thailand for the first time. In 2012,
CIV H3N2 was discovered in Thailand from dogs with flu-like symptoms [2]. Here, CIV and CRCoV were the most frequently detected viruses in
CIRDC-infected dogs, suggesting that the viruses might spread rapidly. These viruses were
not only found in single infections, but they were also found as co-infections together or
with other viruses.
index 26
data This study also exhibited a higher level of infections compared with a previous report
[15], although this might be caused by the
different timing of sample collection, population size and locations. However, it has
previously been reported that infection with CRCoV and CPIV might facilitate or initiate the
disease and, subsequently, enhance the entry of other pathogens [7], so the prevalence of infected dogs is then increased. Moreover, we
found that the dogs that were infected with CIV, CPIV, CDV and CRCoV showed a greater
severity of clinical symptoms, such as marked bronchopneumonia and sudden death (data not
shown). This finding is consistent with other investigations suggesting that co-infections
might augment the severity of clinical symptoms [7,
16]. Thus, advanced genetic-based detection
methods, such as multiplex PCR assays, are considered as an alternative diagnostic platform
for a panel of suspected CIRDC causing viruses with a high sensitivity and specificity.
Because of the cost benefit and practical usage, the developed multiplex PCR assays are
suitable for a screening test for disease diagnosis, quarantine and prevention measures,
especially in developing countries.

data A decrease in balance control can be caused by various factors, including central nervous system diseases (such as stroke and traumatic brain injury), musculoskeletal disorders (such as back pain or arthritis), and vestibular diseases. Loss of balance control decreases the ability and speed of patients' gait, especially in those with hemiplegia caused by brain damage. Fear of falling in these patients reduces their activity level and makes daily activities of living difficult for these patients. Therefore, improvements in balance control and mechanical movements are important treatment goals [1].
index 0
data A combination of several factors, including vestibular, visual, somatosensory, and trunk strength, enables the maintenance of postural balance. Therefore, comprehensive, objective treatment methods are needed. Previous studies have reported on the relationship between gait ability, speed, and independence of performing daily activities from multiple angles. Physicians use various treatment methods and exercises, including trampoline training [2], visual feedback training [3], and sling exercise therapy for trunk muscles [456]. Along with the active development of rehabilitation equipment, physicians use many types of equipment that are already made in Korea in treatments to improve balance, including the iBalance (CyberMedic, Iksan, Korea) and Space Balance 3D (CyberMedic) systems. However, few studies exist on the actual effectiveness of this equipment, and established criteria to evaluate functional improvements are scarce. This study aimed to investigate whether the Spine Balance three-dimensional (3D) system, which was developed to strengthen the deep muscles of the vertebra via stabilization exercise of the lumbar spine, improves postural balance in patients with hemiplegia performing 3D rotational exercises. We expected that this exercise would increase trunk muscle strength and stabilize movement of the vertebra. In addition, this study aimed to study the improvement in gait and ability to carry out daily activities while proving the positive effects of using the Spine Balance 3D system's program and several balance control tests. The results were compared to those obtained with a Biodex Balance System [7], which is widely used for balance training, to prove its effectiveness.
index 1
data This study required patients to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients at 6 months or more after stroke, (2) unilateral stroke (infarction, hemorrhage), (3) ability to understand and perform three-step verbal instructions, and (4) ability to stand independently. Patients with severe abnormalities in their biorhythms who require inpatient treatment and those who were deemed unqualified for the study were excluded. Thirty patients who met the requirements were chosen as subjects. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 15 to create experimental and control groups to be respectively treated using Spine Balance 3D (CyberMedic) and Biodex Balance System (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). The random distribution of the subjects into the experimental and control groups is based on a random allocation table in the order of registration of the subjects, and the process of patient recruitment took a total of 4 months. We conducted this prospective study at the Chonbuk National University Hospital, and we notified the subjects regarding the content of the study and obtained their written consent before the experiment was conducted. The hospital's board of audit and inspection approved our study.
index 2
data BBS (range, 0–56 scores) and TUG indicated the dynamic balance, Biodex Balance System's evaluation program indicated stability, Spine Balance 3D system's evaluation program indicated trunk muscle strength, and 10mWT indicated gait ability. The FRT indicated static balance, and the KFES-I measured the risk of falling. The patients performed TUG, a test that measures the time it takes a patient to rise from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down, and a stopwatch was used to measure timing. We measured the time it takes a patient to walk a distance of 10 m marked by tapelines when performing the 10mWT, and sufficient space was provided before and after the 10 m region to allow acceleration and deceleration. The forward FRT was performed by measuring the difference between the locations of the 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint of the unaffected side from a normal standing position and from a maximally forward-leaning position, and a 100 cm-long ruler was set horizontally at the acromion level to measure the difference. The patients placed both clavicles perpendicular to the long ruler lines on the wall to avoid error caused by the decrease in ipsilateral muscle strength. We separately measured the values for the affected and unaffected side in the lateral FRT. The lateral FRT measures the differences in the location of the metacarpophalangeal joints after abduction of the arm on the desired side from a natural upright position and from a laterally tilted trunk position. If the strength of the affected arm was not sufficiently strong, we measured the acromion locations instead. The Biodex Balance System and Spine Balance 3D system objectively evaluated the balance control. We used Biodex Balance System's evaluation program to conduct postural stability test with eyes open and closed, along with the limits of the stability test. We conducted the postural stability test by having the subjects maintain a relaxed standing position with eyes open and closed for 10 seconds each. We obtained three measurements from each condition to calculate the overall stability index, which reflected the stability as it approximates 0. We conducted the limits of the stability test on an easy level. We obtained three measurements to calculate the overall direction control score, which reflected a higher ability to control direction as the score decreased. Spine Balance 3D system's blind and open modes were used to evaluate the balance control. The difference between the blind mode and the open mode is defined as the ability to display the actual balance status on the screen by using the sensors attached to the back of the patient. The monitor displayed the actual balance status in the open mode whereas the screen turned black in the blind mode to restrict compensation. We increased the tilt in each of the eight directions to 15° and 30° by 2°/s and stopped for 5 seconds at the maximum tilt (15° and 30°). The subjects maintained a certain trunk position, depending on the tilt, and the results were reported as the Balance Position Ratio (BRP), expressed as the percentage of deviation from reference for the direction and tilt measured using the trunk sensor system. A score close to 100% reflects a good trunk muscle strength.
index 3
data We performed the statistical analyses using SPSS ver. 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and analyzed the demographics of the two groups and pre-treatment evaluations by using an independent t-test. We compared the pre-treatment evaluations with post-treatment evaluations in both groups to determine whether statistical changes were present. We analyzed the measured values before and after the treatment in each group by using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and considered only p-values less than 0.05 to be statistically significant.
index 4
data The experimental and control groups comprised 15 subjects each. However, one patient from the experimental group failed due to the aggravation of gout in the ankle joint, and a follow-up loss in the control group occurred due to a MERS coronavirus outbreak. Fourteen subjects in each group completed the clinical experiment. Table 1 shows the distribution of sex, age, average education, duration of stroke, and hemiplegic side in both groups. The demographics in the two groups did not show significant differences. The unaffected lateral FRT showed significantly higher results in the Biodex Balance System training group; whereas the rest of the tests showed no significant differences between the two groups (Table 2).
index 5
data Table 3 shows that the experimental group showed significant improvements in all tests—BBS (p=0.001), TUG (p=0.001), forward FRT (p=0.001), affected lateral FRT (p=0.001), and unaffected lateral FRT (p=0.002)—when the values before and after training were compared in each group. The control group also showed significant improvements in the same tests. However, the results for the 10mWT showed only significant improvements in the experimental group (11.38±3.0 to 10.12±2.47 seconds; p=0.01); whereas the control group did not show significant improvements. The improvement levels of the trunk strength (BPR score) for the experimental group using Spine Balance 3D system's evaluation program showed significant improvements at the 15° open mode; whereas the control group did not show any significant improvement. However, both groups showed significant improvements during the experiment under the following three conditions: 15° blind, 30° open, and 30° blind (Table 3). In addition, among the three conditions used in Biodex Balance System's evaluation program, the experimental group showed significant improvements in a postural stability test with eyes open and closed under two conditions while the control group showed significant improvements in a postural stability test under a condition with closed eyes and a limit of stability test. As such, the two groups showed similar levels of improvement in terms of stability (Table 3).
index 6
data The goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the Spine Balance 3D system in improving gait and balance in patients with hemiplegia. This study confirms that balance training using the Spine Balance 3D system effectively improves dynamic balance, static balance, and gait by improving trunk muscle strength. Treatment using the Spine Balance 3D system showed significant improvements in gait, as measure in the 10mWT, compared to that achieved using the Biodex Balance System, and the Spine Balance 3D system's evaluation program showed that improvements in trunk control ability were relatively superior than those observed for the control group. The postural stability test, conducted using Biodex Balance System's evaluation program, revealed that the two groups showed similar levels of improvement in stability.
index 7
data The trunk stability maintains the overall balance and regulates the technical movement of the lower limbs. Hodges and Richardson [8] report that stabilization of the spine caused by the contraction of abdominal and multifidus muscles plays a role in inducing technical movement in the lower limbs. In addition, Kim et al. [9] report that trunk-activating exercises are important because weakening of the trunk is relevant to functional performance in patients with chronic stroke. Abdominal muscle strength exercises improve gait and balance in stroke patients [10], and improvements in trunk regulation increase dynamic balance, gait speed, and symmetrical movement of the trunk during gait in stroke patients [11].
index 8
data Subsequently, various core stability exercises have been introduced to strengthen the trunk [12131415], and many types of modern equipment are currently in development, aiming to improve trunk strength through gait training. However, studies evaluating the effects of such equipment are rare. A study conducted 1-minute sit-up tests in a single-leg squat position on athletes after training with the Biodex Balance System and reported a relatively significant improvement in balance compared to the control group. This study proves that treatment using the Biodex Balance System improves stability by fortifying core strength [16]. Treatment using the Biodex Balance System significantly reduces the fear of falling (FES-I score >26) among the elderly, and their knee extensor and flexor isometric strength improves as a secondary gain [17]. Therefore, core muscle and lower extremity strength are expected to increase when training using the Biodex Balance System, and improvements in balance have been confirmed.
index 9
data Our study showed significant improvements not only in trunk muscle strength, but also in BBS, TUG, FRT, and KFES-I. This result coincides with the results from a study by Saeys et al. [18], which reports that trunk reposition error, trunk impairment scale, and TUG results improved in the weight-shifting training group compared to those in the control group. The only difference with the study by Saeys et al. [18] is that our weight-shifting training was conducted using the Biodex Balance System.
index 10
data We expect that the newly-developed Spine Balance 3D systems stabilize and fortify trunk muscles by inducing symmetrical contraction and relaxation of abdominal and multifidus muscles in 3D space when the body is tilted, and studies are currently in progress to determine its effectiveness. A recent study confirmed changes in the trunk muscle strength and body composition among elderly subjects after training using the Spine Balance 3D system. The experimental group showed a significant improvement in trunk muscle strength after analyzing the alignment of the system direction and tilt with the trunk sensors by using trunk maintenance ability as a reference for trunk muscle strength [19].
index 11
data Our study showed a significant improvement in trunk muscle strength in both groups after the experiment when measured using the same method. However, the control group showed significant improvements in trunk muscle strength only under three conditions while the experimental group showed improvements in trunk muscle strength under all four tested conditions, and the experimental group showed a relatively higher improvement in the trunk muscle strength. The tests conducted using Biodex Balance System's evaluation program revealed that both the experimental and the control groups showed significant improvements in two of three conditions with similar magnitude. The experimental group showed significant improvements in a postural stability test with eyes open and closed under two conditions while the control group showed significant improvements in postural stability test under a condition with closed eyes condition and in the limit of stability test. Although each system's learning effect on outcomes cannot be neglected, the treatment effect of the experimental group who used the Spine Balance 3D system for training was confirmed to be superior to that of the control group through a comparative analysis. Compared to the Biodex Balance System, where balance training is conducted horizontally while standing perpendicular to the surface, the Spine Balance 3D system might be more effective because the trunk muscle is activated to maintain the body balance against increasing gravitational force caused by the increase in tilt angle in 3D space.
index 12
data We conclude that both the Biodex Balance System and the Spine Balance 3D system increase core muscle strength. However, the 3D stimulation in the Spine Balance 3D system is more effective to activate the trunk muscles. The dynamic balance improves as shown in the BBS, TUG, FRT, and KFES-I, and the 10mWT, which refers to gait ability, and shows a relatively higher improvement compared to the Biodex Balance System. We expect that the Spine Balance 3D system's superior treatment improves static balance, dynamic balance, and gait in stroke patients.
index 13
data This study has several limitations. First, both the experimental and control groups comprise a small number of subjects of only 14 each. Second, although there were no restrictions for registration, each subject was able to walk independently for 10 m or more, and their BBS scores were over 40, which means that the subjects had relatively mild conditions. Third the long-term effects of the treatment could not be confirmed. In addition, we could not exclude the learning effect for each evaluation system. Finally, the level of the trunk muscle activity could not be directly proven. Therefore, future studies need to include more subjects, and treatment methods should also be confirmed in subjects with more severe conditions. In addition, a method that can directly quantify trunk muscle strength, such as electromyography (EMG) activity, should also be attempted, and the studies should be designed to explore whether the treatment effects are still present months after the experiment.
index 14
data In conclusion, the Spine Balance 3D system, a newly-developed trunk-stabilizing exercise equipment, and the Biodex Balance system were applied to patients with hemiplegia. Although significant improvements in dynamic and static balance were confirmed in both the experimental and control groups, the 10mWT showed a significant improvement only in the experimental group treated with the Spine Balance 3D system, which means that the gait ability also showed a significant improvement and that the activation of the trunk muscles was more effective when using the program of the Spine Balance 3D system. The results indicate that the Spine Balance 3D System induces the activation of trunk muscles and comprises an effective treatment to improve the balance and gait in patients with hemiplegia.

data Following the isolation of a previously unknown coronavirus (CoV) from the sputum of a man aged 60 years in 2012,1 1618 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been reported throughout 26 countries, with 579 cases resulting in death.2 The vast majority of these 26 countries reported MERS cases after experiencing an exportation event from the Arabian Peninsula.3
4 Most cases to date have occurred in Saudi Arabia, followed by South Korea, which experienced an outbreak of MERS after the return of an infected businessman who had been travelling in Middle East.5
index 0
data The exact zoonotic source of MERS-CoV and its mode of transmission in humans remain unclear. Although related sequences have been detected in several bat species,6 MERS-CoV has not been isolated from bats. However, MERS-CoV has been isolated from dromedary camels. A high rate of seropositivity has been confirmed in the camels of Arabian Peninsula, with no evidence of MERS-CoV infection detected in cows, goats or sheep.7–10 One study isolated the full MERS-CoV genome sequences from a dromedary camel and from a patient who died of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection after close contact with camels; the two isolates were identical. According to serological data, MERS-CoV had been circulating in the camel—but not in the patient—before human infection occurred, suggesting that MERS-CoV had been transmitted to the patient via the infected camel.11
index 1
data Whether MERS-CoV is new to camel or human populations or whether it has been present but undetected for years remains unknown. Nonetheless, MERS-CoV was initially regarded primarily as a zoonotic pathogen, with only limited documentation of person-to-person transmission. However, MERS outbreaks of varying proportions have since occurred across Saudi Arabia; additionally, apparent cases of sustained secondary transmission have occurred in family clusters12
13 and healthcare facilities.14
15
index 2
data Much remains unknown about MERS, including the risk factors associated with MERS-CoV transmissions in outbreak and non-outbreak settings. Here, we aimed to increase our understanding of the spread and mode of transmission of MERS-CoV by comparing the epidemiological, demographic and clinical characteristics of outbreak and non-outbreak MERS-CoV infections from September 2012 to October 2015 as reported to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MOH).
index 3
data All data collected were stored and analysed using SAS (V.9.4) software. Univariate and descriptive statistics were conducted to estimate proportions. Associations between age and two variables (gender and death) were assessed using a χ2 test. χ2 analysis using Yates' correction was performed on the data set to compare case characteristics among outbreak and non-outbreak cases. Distributions of time between onset and confirmation, onset and notification and onset and death (among patients that died) were also determined for outbreak and non-outbreak cases. All reported p values are two-tailed and were considered to be statistically significant at p<0.05.
index 4
data The prevalence of MERS-CoV was highest in the Riyadh region with 46.91% of the total reported cases, followed by the Jeddah (21%), AlAhsa (5.69%), AlMadinah Almonowarah (4.81%), Eastern (4.73%), AlTaif (4.33%) and Makkah (3.29%) regions. The remaining regions comprised 9.14% of the total reported cases (figure 1). More than 31% of all confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia were reported in April and May 2014. The highest number of outbreaks was reported to have occurred in April and May 2014, the second highest in September 2015 and the third highest in February and March 2015.
index 5
data During the study period, a total of 1250 patients from 0 to 109 years old were reported as infected with MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV was prevalent among individuals who were 30 years or older; in contrast, individuals who were 26 years or younger exhibited very low incidence. The distribution of age for all reported cases was almost normal, with a mean of 50.825 years and an SD of 19.494 years. MERS-CoV was more prevalent in men (64.77% of total reported cases) than in women. Women had an average age of 48 years (SD, 19 years), with a minimum of zero and maximum of 90 years. Men had an average age of 52 years (SD, 19 years), with a minimum of zero and a maximum of 109 years (table 1). We found a significant association between age and gender (χ2=15.22; p<0.01) and between gender and death for patients diagnosed with MERS-CoV (χ2=12.75; p<0.01).
index 6
data Online supplementary table S1 presents the nationalities of patients diagnosed with MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. Most patients were Saudi (66%), followed by Filipino (10.99%), Indian (3.99%) and Yemeni (3.69%) nationalities.
index 7
data Univariate analysis revealed that older individuals—namely, those older than the mean age of 50.825 years—represented a larger than expected proportion of outbreak than of non-outbreak cases (p<0.001; table 2). The prevalence of MERS-CoV infections among men was comparable for outbreak and non-outbreak cases (p=0.239; table 2). Similarly, approximately two-thirds of all Saudi MERS diagnoses occurred among Saudi nationals for outbreak and non-outbreak cases (p=0.558; table 2). Healthcare workers comprised 22% of all confirmed Saudi MERS cases for outbreak and non-outbreak cases (p=0.920; table 2). However, nosocomial infections, which comprised one-third of all confirmed Saudi MERS cases, occurred much more frequently among outbreak cases than among non-outbreak cases (p<0.001). Patients who became infected during outbreaks were more likely to die of MERS than those infected during non-outbreak conditions (p<0.001).
index 8
data Of the patients reporting data on camel exposure, 17% of the 123 non-outbreak cases and 10% of the 81 outbreak cases indicated that they owned or raised camels; this difference was not statistically significant.
index 9
data The average time from onset to confirmation was 6.6 days for outbreak cases and 11.9 days for non-outbreak cases. For outbreak cases and non-outbreak cases, the average time from onset to notification was 5.3 and 9.2 days, respectively. Among patients who died, the average time from onset to death was 15.6 days for outbreak cases and 19.5 days for non-outbreak cases. All three distributions were long-tailed, and non-outbreak cases were skewed further right (figures 2–5).
index 10
data Using the Saudi MOH CCC public health data set on MERS cases reported to have occurred from September 2012 to September 2015, we found three factors distinguishing outbreak and non-outbreak cases: (1) patients older than the mean age of 51 years represented a larger than expected fraction of outbreak than of non-outbreak cases, (2) nosocomial infections occurred much more frequently among outbreak cases than among non-outbreak cases and (3) patients infected during outbreaks were more likely to die of MERS-CoV infection than those infected during non-outbreak conditions (table 2).
index 11
data Given that age was associated with death, it is worth noting that the third factor may be explained in part by the over-representation of older individuals among the outbreak cases. Although age was also associated with gender, we found that the proportion of MERS-CoV infections in men was approximately two-thirds for outbreak and non-outbreak cases (table 2). However, the general over-representation of men is consistent with many previous studies showing predominantly male patients with MERS-CoV.3

index 12
data Our results also showed that healthcare workers comprised 22% of all Saudi MERS cases diagnosed up to October 2015 (table 2). This percentage is in agreement with a 2014 WHO report stating that 109 of the 402 (∼25%) reported MERS-CoV infections in the Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) 2014 outbreak occurred in healthcare workers.16 Areas neighbouring Saudi Arabia, including the city of Al-Ain in the United Arab Emirates, also reported MERS-CoV infections in 16 healthcare workers out of 23 total cases.17 Additionally, during the large South Korean outbreak in 2015, 14% of the infected cases were in healthcare workers.5
index 13
data Another 2014 WHO report stated that most person-to-person MERS-CoV infections likely occurred in healthcare settings.18 We found that nosocomial transmissions comprised one-third of all Saudi MERS-CoV cases reported to date. Importantly, these nosocomial infections occurred more frequently in outbreak cases than in non-outbreak cases, suggesting that nosocomial infections fuelled outbreaks (table 2). The first outbreak in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, (2013) provided valuable information about MERS-CoV transmission in a healthcare setting. The outbreak started in a haemodialysis unit of a private hospital in Al-Hasa, but subsequently spread to three other hospitals. Phylogenetic analysis of the outbreak showed that only eight of the epidemiological transmissions were related, indicating multiple zoonotic introductions of MERS-CoV.18
index 14
data To date, MERS-CoV has been detected in camels from Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Jordan and Kenya,7

20 and it has been shown that humans can acquire MERS-CoV directly from dromedary camels.21 Since camel exposure data (ie, whether the patient owned or raised camels) were gathered for only 204 of the 1250 cases in the database used by this study, we did not include this information in table 2. Nonetheless, we found that 17% of the 123 non-outbreak cases and 10% of the 81 outbreak cases reporting data on camel exposure indicated that the patients owned or raised camels. Although this difference was not statistically significant, this result suggested that camel exposure, and thus zoonotic transmission, might be more common among sporadic, non-outbreak cases than among outbreak cases. A full analysis of this relationship will require more vigilant collection of camel exposure data.
index 15
data This study was limited by the information available in the Saudi MOH CCC public health data set on MERS-CoV infections that were reported to have occurred between September 2012 and October 2015. The surveillance system and data collection forms were inconsistent over the years during which these data were acquired, likely due to major leadership changes in the MOH. The outbreak cases have thus far been confirmed faster than non-outbreak cases, indicating that improved future surveillance may allow for faster identification of sporadic cases (figure 5).
index 16
data Although it has been 3 years since MERS-CoV was first identified in humans, cases continue to occur in household and healthcare settings, though our results indicated that most person-to-person transmissions involved healthcare-associated infections. Nosocomial outbreaks likely begin when a primary patient seeks care and then escalates due to insufficient implementation of scalable infection control measures. Our results indicate that the best way to control MERS-CoV infections may be to block its spread by practicing rigorous infection control measures in hospitals. Therefore, strengthening of infection control measures in healthcare settings will be critical to the prevention of future outbreaks.

data Maedi/visna virus (MVV) is a lentivirus from family Retroviridae that mainly affects domestic sheep [11, 14]. Infected sheep develop fatal and progressive pneumonia and encephalomyelitis after a latent period of several months to years. Most MVV-infected sheep are asymptomatic but produce a specific antibody that persists for life [11, 13]. Therefore, effective and practical sero-diagnostic tests for identification of infected animals are needed for serological surveys. ELISA and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) tests have been used for the antibody survey [4], and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been employed for pathogen detection [1]. SCP cells, which originate from the sheep brain choroid plexus (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] No. CRL-1700), have been reported to be an MVV-sensitive cell line [15] but contaminated with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) [2]. MVV infection is recognized worldwide [16], but the prevalence of the disease has been unknown in Japan. A recent serological survey revealed that there were seropositive sheep in Hokkaido and Iwate Prefectures according to a test for the MVV antigen [5], and MVV was isolated from one of the seropositive sheep in Iwate Prefecture [12]. Using this isolate, we attempted to prepare a cell line that is persistently infected with MVV without contamination by other viruses and mycoplasmas.
index 0
data The Iwate strain of MVV, which was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of a seropositive sheep in Japan, was used in the present study [12]. The virus was propagated in a primary culture of fetal goat lung (FGL) cells and used after filtration through a 450-nm Millipore filter. Information pertaining to the isolation of the virus was reported previously [12].
index 1
data Three cell lines were selected for the preparation of MVV-infected cells in the present study. The first cell line, ZZ-R, originates from the tongue of a fetal goat, an animal sensitive to MVV. The cell line was obtained from Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, (Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Federal Republic of Germany; Catalog number CCLV-RIE 127) and cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and Ham’s F12 medium at a 1:1 ratio supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) [3]. The second cell line, FLK-N3, originated from a fetal lamb kidney and was obtained from the National Institute of Animal Health (Tsukuba, Japan) [10]. The cells showed a cytopathic effect (CPE) after infection with the MVV M88 strain [10]. The third cell line, CCL-88, originated from bat lung fibroblasts and was acquired from ATCC. The cell line is sensitive to bovine leukemia virus (BLV), one of ruminant retroviruses, and a persistently BLV-infected cell lines have been established [6]. FLK-N3 and CCL-88 cells were cultivated in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% of FBS. All culture media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.
index 2
data The cell suspension was seeded in a 6-well plastic plate and cultivated at 37°C for 1 day. After removal of the culture fluid, the cells were inoculated with 0.2 ml of cell-free infectious material (the culture fluid of FGL infected with MVV), incubated for 1 hr, and cultivated at 37°C in a maintenance medium, which contained a reduced FBS concentration (2%). These cells were cultivated for 7 days at the maximum, and the passages were repeated in T-25 tissue culture flasks. Approximately 106 cells and 100 μl of culture media were collected from each passage and subjected to PCR testing for proviral MVV.
index 3
data PCR was performed using the GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.) to amplify a partial sequence of the long terminal repeat (LTR) [1]. DNA was extracted using a Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The primer pair used to amplify LTR was LTR 2s (5′-CAGAAATCATAGTCAGGATGACAC) and LTA 2a (5′-CCACGTTGGGCGCCAGCTGCGAGA). Amplification of LTR was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec. The MVV-positive control was prepared from FGL infected with the MVV Iwate strain. The amplification of LTR was not observed when cells of early passages were analyzed (i.e., passages 3 through 6) after virus inoculation. Nonetheless, ZZ-R cells became MMV-positive (according to PCR) after several additional passages and continued to be virus-positive after 18 passages (Fig. 1). As for the PCR products, a slightly large clear-cut band was noticed together with a band of expected size. Amplification of LTR was not observed in other cell lines, including FLK-N3 (after 24 passages) and CCL-88 (after 20 passages). The LTR gene sequences from passage 18 of ZZ-R cells were analyzed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit on an Applied Biosystems 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). It was confirmed that there was no difference in the sequence between the product of expected size and those of the Iwate strain. The large clear-cut PCR product was also sequenced, and we found that the 82 bases including the primer part in the amplicon of expected size were tandemly repeated at the 5′ end. The redundant parts were almost identical in sequence except their five bases at the 3′ end were different between the two viral strains. Therefore, the clear-cut band was also specific, and the mutant virus might be able to grow well (as compared to the original virus) in ZZ-R cells.
index 4
data The MVV antigen for the AGID test was prepared using culture fluids of ZZ-R cells infected with MVV and cultivated for more than 18 passages. The culture fluids were concentrated using ammonium sulfate, dialyzed with PBS and further concentrated with polyethylene glycol 6000 according to published procedures [8]. These concentrated virus-containing fluids were treated with 1.0% Triton X-100 and used as antigens for antiviral antibodies. The AGID tests were performed according to the OIE manual. The gel consisted of 1.0% Noble agar, 8.5% NaCl and 10 mM phosphate buffer. The wells were 5 mm in diameter, and six circumferential wells were placed at a distance of 3 mm from the central well. The central well was filled with the control antiserum, and two exterior wells were filled with the positive-control antigen and PBS, respectively. The positive-control MVV antigen and antiserum were provided by the National Institute of Animal Health (Tsukuba, Japan). The MVV antigen was serially diluted and placed in the remaining four wells. The gel diffusion plate was allowed to stand at room temperature for 48 hr and was examined for precipitation lines. The antigen concentrated approximately 50-fold from the culture fluids formed a precipitation line until 1:8 dilutions and connected to a line produced between the positive reference serum and reference antigen (Fig. 2).
index 5
data According to the information (cell line details) about ZZ-R documented by Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, which provided ZZ-R cells, the cells are free of contamination by bacteria, Mycoplasma, fungi and viruses, such as bovine herpesvirus 1 and 4, bovine and porcine rotavirus type A, bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine leukemia virus, bovine rotavirus type 1, bovine and porcine adenoviruses, BVDV, classical fever virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine parvovirus and porcine enterovirus. No viral particles were detected in the cells by repeated electron microscopy examinations. We also tried to rule out the contamination with mycoplasma and BVDV, which are often detected in cultivated cells. The cell pellets were subjected to PCR testing for both agents [7, 17] and found to be free of them. Therefore, we believe that a cell line persistently producing MVV and at least free of the contamination with mycoplasma and BVDV has been established.
index 6
data It was previously reported that FLK-N3 cells show CPE after infection with MVV but not with caprine arthritis encephalitis virus though their biological properties are very similar [10]. The Iwate strain did not grow in the FLK-N3 cell line in the present study. These phenomena may be related to the history of in vitro passages of each virus. Equine infectious anemia virus, another lentivirus, well adapted to primary horse leukocyte culture, was found to be infective for cultivated horse kidney cells [9]. If the FLK-N3 cell line was infected with the Iwate strain after a long-term subculture in primary FGL cells, then an FLK-N3 cell line persistently infected with MVV might be established.
index 7
data Because most retroviruses do not produce obvious CPE and persistently infect cultivated cells in vitro, virus neutralization tests are not easy for their serological tests, and ELISA and AGID are used for the antibody survey. Because lentiviruses are not oncogenic and do not malignantly transform cells as oncoviruses do, an established cell line is required for persistent production of a lentivirus. Because ZZ-R cells were shown to continuously release MVV antigens, this cell line may be used to produce large amounts of a viral antigen for serological tests.

data CPV-2 is the main etiological agent of viral gastroenteritis in dogs. It is a member of the Parvoviridae family, belonging to the
Protoparvovirus genus and Protoparvovirus type 1 species. It is a non-enveloped virus with a single stranded DNA genome, which
encodes for two capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2, required for the assembly and packaging of the viral genome, as well as for NS1 and NS2 nonstructural proteins, which
aid in controlling DNA replication, assembly and regulation of genes expression [24].
index 0
data Over the past years, CPV-2 has developed new antigenic variants. In 1980, CPV-2 original strain was replaced by the variant designated type 2a (CPV-2a), in 1984,
CPV-2b was identified [23], and in 2001, CPV-2c was detected and reported in Italy. The last variant has also been identified
in Asia, Africa and America. Due to the existence of multiple antigenic variants for CPV-2, the clinical signs can vary greathly [6].Subsequently, veterinarians have less certainty when issuing their presuntive diagnosis, and usually, some laboratory tests are required in order to
confirm their diagnosis; although several techniques have been developed in research laboratories, such as hemagglutination assays, immunofluorescence, ELISA, PCR,
immunochromatography test and cell culture (among others), actually techniques with the greatest availability within clinical laboratories in veterinary hospitals
only are the immunochromatography test and PCR, however, in the research about the sensitivity and specificity of these procedures, the reports are controversial.
Moreover, in patients with varying degrees of illness severity, the sensitivity and specificity of these techniques have not been extensively studied.
index 1
data The objective of this study is to report the advantages and disadvantages offered by immunochromatography test and PCR for the diagnosis of patients that present a
wide diversity of clinical signs for CPV-2.
index 2
data This study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Experimental Animal Research Mexican Official Norm NOM-062-ZOO-1999.
index 3
data Dogs with clinical enteritis hospitalized in the Veterinary Hospital for Small Animals of the Universidad Autónoma de Estado de México, were screened for this
study and selected based on tested positive or negative CPV-2 using nested PCR (nPCR). As a result, 45 dogs that tested positive were selected, and 5 negatively
tested dogs were included as controls. The 50 dogs were clinically examined by three veterinarians simultaneously to obtain sensitivity of clinical diagnosis. Each
veterinarian issued his presumptive diagnosis in a discrete manner, using the problem oriented veterinary medical record (POVMR) as their diagnostic tool.
index 4
data Next, fecal samples of all dogs were analyzed through PCR and immunochromatography test, while blood samples were used to perform a complete blood count.
index 5
data nPCR is considered a highly reliable and sensitive technique to identify CPV-2 viral particles [11, 13], and therefore, in this study, the sensitivity of the used tests was correlated to those obtained previously from nPCR, for CPV-2
diagnosis.
index 6
data Dog’s stool samples were obtained using rectal swabs, which were suspended in nuclease-free water and 200 µl of the homogenates, and were used for
DNA extraction. The procedure was performed using the QIAamp® DNA Stool DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN, Mainz, Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions. All
DNA samples were quantified using a Q5000 Quawell spectrophotometer (Quawell Technology, Inc., San Jose, CA, U.S.A.). 100 ng of DNA of each sample
were used for PCR reactions with 50 µl of final volume. Previously, a pair of primers was designed in our laboratory to amplify a 275 bp fragment,
ParvoInt2FB (5′-TCAAGCAGATGGTGATCCAAG-3′) and ParvoInt2CR (5′-GGTACATTATTTAATGCAGTTA-3′) located at nucleotides 1,107–1,130 and 1,360–1,382 of the VP2 gene (GenBank
accession number FJ0051962c).
index 7
data PCR reactions were performed using 2 µl of each primer (200 nM), 12.5 µl of GoTaq® Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI,
U.S.A.) containing DNA polymerase, reaction Buffer (pH 8.5) and 400 µM of each nucleotide (dATP, dGTP, Dctp and dTTP); 3 mM of MgCl2.
and 28.5 µl of nuclease free water. All reactions were carried out under the following amplification conditions; 1 cycle at 94°C for 5 min for
initial denaturation, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 52°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min and a final extension cycle at 72°C for 5 min.
index 8
data nPCR was initially done amplifying a fragment of 1,740 bp using ParvoExt1f (5′-ATGAGTGATGGAGCAGTTCA-3′) and ParvoExt3R (5′-AGGTGCTAGTTGAGATTTTTCATATAC-3′) primers,
and were designed using the nucleotide sequences 1–20 and 1,712–1,740 from gene VP2 for canine parvovirus (GenBank accession number FJ0051962c). Reaction was
standardized to a final volume of 50 µl.
index 9
data The reaction mix contained 1 µl of GoTaq® Flexi DNA Polymerase 5 U/µl (Promega), 5 µl of GoTaq® Flexi buffer 5X
Green, 3 µl of MgCl2 25 mM, 4 µl dNTP’s 200 µM, 2 µl of primers, 10
µl of DNA with a final concentration of 100 ng and 23 µl of nuclease free water. The reaction was carried out
under the following amplification conditions: 1 cycle at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 50°C for 45 sec, 72°C for 1 min and 1 cycle at
72°C for 5 min. Afterwards, 1 µl of the product of this reaction was used as a DNA template for the nesting procedure, and primers and
amplification conditions were the same for 275 bp fragment.
index 10
data All the amplification products were identified through horizontal electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels stained with 0.5 µg/ml of
ethidium bromide and visualized with a UV transilluminator.
index 11
data For the analysis of immunochromatography test for canine parvovirus (CPV Ag), the ANIGEN® kit (Bionote Inc., Gyeonggi-do, Korea) was utilized. Each test
was carried out following manufacturer’s instructions.
index 12
data Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein using vacutainer tubes with EDTA as anticoagulant. Complete blood cell counts (CBC) were performed using an
automated cell counter (QBC vet-IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME, U.S.A.). The blood films were stained with Wright-Giemsa and examined under a photonic
microscope. Leukopenia was considered when a total CBC count was less than 6 × 103/µl [3].
index 13
data Results analysis was performed through the use of a matrix for encoded variables [20], and contingency tables were created
to determine the diagnostic test properties [12]. Furthermore, the Kappa statistic was determined to
estimate the agreement between the three used tests, and nPCR. The kappa value was characterized according to Kantere and colleagues in 2015 where
Kappa value 1 indicates absolute agreement, whereas a value of 0 indicates that agreement occurs due to chance. In general,
Kappa values higher than 0.6 indicate a good agreement level; the analysis was carried out using the statistical package SPSS Ver. 22.0 (IBM,
Inc., Armonk, NY, U.S.A.).
index 14
data Ninety one point one (91.1) % of positive dogs for CPV-2 by nPCR were pure bred; 95.5% of the patients were between two and eight months old, and 4.5% were older
than one year. Concerning their vaccination status, 40% were vaccinated at least once to prevent CPV-2 infection.
index 15
data Frequency of clinical signs showed by these dogs was as follows: 44.4% displayed vomiting and diarrhea; 20% had fever, vomiting and diarrhea
(catarrhal or hemorrhagic); 17.7% showed only diarrhea; 8.8% displayed only vomiting; and 4.4% had diarrhea and fever, and 4.4% presented vomiting and fever.
Leukopenia was observed in 48.8% of the dogs (Table 1).
index 16
data Using clinical examination, veterinarians diagnosed only 57.8% of patients positive to CPV-2 and 100% of the negative dogs; therefore, the sensitivity value for
clinical diagnosis was estimated as 57.7% (CI0.95 42.2–72), and the observed specificity was 100% (CI0.95 46.2–98.8).
index 17
data Regarding laboratory tests diagnosis, out of 100% of dogs that resulted positive through nPCR, only 30/45 of these patients were CPV-2 positive through
immunochromatography test, while the five control patients that tested negative for CPV-2 were correctly diagnosed. Therefore, this technique showed a sensitivity
of 66.6% (CI0.95 50.9–79.5), and the observed specificity was 100% (CI0.95 46.2–98.8).
index 18
data Using PCR technique, 36/45 patients were positive to CPV-2, and the five control patients were confirmed negative throughout the nPCR. Thus, PCR demonstrated a
sensitivity of 80% (CI0.95 63.1–87.7) and a specificity of 100% (CI0.95 67.8–99.1) (Fig. 1).
index 19
data Agreement among the three techniques is demonstrated through the Kappa value (Table 2).
index 20
data Gastroenteritis caused by CPV-2 is considered one of the main viral diseases that affect dogs. Although clinical signs of canine parvovirus infection may vary, the
most common signs reported were: anorexia, depression, lethargy, fever [10, 18],
mucoid and hemorrhagic diarrhea and leukopenia [1, 6, 21]; in subclinical cases, some of these signs may or may not be present [7, 15].
index 21
data During clinical examination, variability in clinical manifestations of infection was observed. Only 20% of the studied dogs presented typical signs as commonly
described in literature. Clinical variability for this disease has been reported previously [2, 4, 7, 10, 15, 18], and some authors have discussed factors, such as age, immune status, exposure route, viral dose, virulence of strains and co-infection with
other infectious agents as possible causes [4, 15, 18]. This complicates obtaining an accurate diagnosis of CPV-2 when veterinarians rely solely on their clinical examination. Therefore, regarding our
investigation solely based on this procedure, 42.2% of dogs will have a false-negative CPV-2 diagnosis.Through dogs medical records in this study, we observed that
veterinarians were ruling out the possibility of infection primarily because the dogs were not exhibiting the classical clinical signs described in literature, had
been vaccinated against CPV-2 and/or were adults. However, most of the dogs in our study displayed atypical signs. Therefore, we believe that subclinical infections
of CPV-2 are more common, and veterinarians, who must decide whether or not to use additional diagnostic tests with high sensitivity and specificity, should
seriously consider these findings.
index 22
data In this study, 40% of patients positive to CVP-2 had been previously immunized. It is well known that PCR technique is highly sensitive, and therefore, it detects
vaccine viral particles in feces from recently vaccinated patients; studies indicate that it is possible to obtain false-positive results from days 3 to 10
post-vaccination with a modified live CPV vaccine [10, 18]. Consequently, to perform
this study, patients with history of vaccination on the previous 15 days were excluded. Additionally, samples from vaccinated dogs positive to CPV-2 were sequenced,
and in all studied cases, the genovariant CPV-2c was identified (data not show), which implies that dogs were infected with field CPV-2c, knowing that no CPV-2c
vaccine is available yet in Mexico. Moreover, in Mexico, Pedroza and colleagues reported that the most common antigenic variant in infected dogs was CPV-2c [16].
index 23
data On the other hand, many veterinarians consider the presence of leukopenia, a supporting factor for CPV-2 diagnosis. However, we observed that only 48.8% (22/45) of
the studied dogs presented leukopenia during evaluation, which is consistent with other reports that indicated around 50% of dogs don’t display hematologic
alterations at the time of evaluation [18]. Therefore, a CBC is a valuable tool that can provide information about the
disease severity, suggesting a prognosis and determining the response to treatment. However, leukopenia should not be considered as a diagnostic tool for CPV-2,
because it does not provide an evidence for virus presence.
index 24
data Various techniques of viral identification are used for the definitive confirmation of infection by CPV-2, for example, rapid tests based on immunochromatography
are widely used by clinicians, because the procedure is easy, fast and accessible. Additionally, it doesn’t require sample preparation or sending to a specialized
laboratory for analysis. The varying sensitivity of this test is its downside; several studies have indicated that its sensitivity ranges from 50 to 100% [8, 9], and in our study, the comparative sensitivity with nPCR was 66.6%. Some studies have
suggested that the low technique sensitivity is due to the need of a large viral particles quantities to be shed into the stool of dogs to obtain a positive
diagnosis [5, 8, 10, 18]. The use of this technique must be reconsidered, as higher probability of false negative results is expected. In order to prevent this,
further techniques, with higher sensitivities must be used [19].
index 25
data Several studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity of PCR-based tests; currently, there are multiple variants of the same procedure that offer sensitivities
ranges from 80 to 100% [11, 17, 22, 25]. In the present study, PCR had 80% sensitivity, and it’s noteworthy to mention that patients were only identified positive to
infection throught nPCR meanwhile neither PCR nor immunochromatography tests were able to identify it.
index 26
data Regarding the kappa-value, we compared results among the three analyzed methods to nPCR. The poor agreement between clinical diagnosis and nPCR
was demonstrated, nevertheless; moderate agreement was observed between conventional PCR and nPCR which may be due to the similarity between the two tests.
index 27
data Concerning clinical signs, the presence of either vomiting or diarrhea was observed in all virally infected patients, while other clinical signs were not
considered relevant to the infection; in agreement with clinical signs and sensitivity of the used techniques, no relationship was observed. For example, case no.
26 showed only vomiting as a clinical sign, and it was deemed negative for CPV-2 by veterinary clinical diagnosis, however, immunochromatography test, PCR and nPCR
tests were positive to CPV-2. Furthermore, cases 41 and 42 in which the main clinical sign was diarrhea, could only be diagnosed positive to CPV-2 using nPCR.
index 28
data Our data indicate that the most frequently used diagnostic tests in clinical and diagnostic veterinary laboratories to detect CPV-2 are highly specific, but they
lack sensitivity, which prevents the precise diagnosis of CPV-2. In our study, PCR and immunochromatography test were not as sensitive as nPCR, which was confirmed
in previous investigaions [14], however, the use of nPCR as a diagnosis test is not yet wide-spread in veterinary hospitals,
while it remains widely used for research purposes.
index 29
data On the other hand, Real-Time PCR, which is also highly sensitive, is rarely used, because of its high equipment costs and the requirement of a highly specialized
staff for its handling. However, technological advances allowed these techniques to become cheaper and simpler to use, which could lead to their direct application
in veterinary hospitals to improve the diagnostic accuracy for CPV-2.

data It is now more than 70 years since the World Health Organization (WHO) has been in collaborative efforts with the Republic of Korea in keeping of better health for all. Since the 1950s, in line with efforts of international societies, the WHO has been actively involved in various aspects of the public health field in Korea, from the control of parasites to building of community health systems in rural places. Nowadays, Korea has become healthier than ever, and is now engaging in the role as a world leader in contribution of health and development.
index 0
data Through 70 years of independence, war, and poverty, transforming from a recipient country of official development assistance to a significant donor in the global society, our pathway once more emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and the role of WHO in the past years in Korea and neighboring countries. Looking back at the past is meaningful to diagnose the present problems, and to foresee the future of our world.
index 1
data Beginning since summer of 2012, we have gathered together to view the past, present and future of the public health field in the scope of cooperation between WHO and the Republic of Korea. Extensive research in national and international archives, interviews with living witnesses of the history, and to prepare the manuscript, was not only to bring memorandum of the past, but was to bring insights and to share the experiences with neighbors in our world. While celebrating the 70th year of relationship, we hereby present the book: 70 Years Working Together for Health: The World Health Organization and the Republic of Korea (1).
index 2
data Standing on the road of history, this is an important moment for the WHO and the Republic of Korea to convey the past history of connection and collaboration, identify where we stand at the present moment, and prepare for our future contribution in global health and development.
index 3
data The overall process took place from August 2012 to December 2016. We first collected records, papers and manuscripts, publications, and historical materials documenting the public health of Republic of Korea from 1945 to the present. The National Archives of Korea, which serves as the principal repository for the official government records of Korea, including newspapers and broadcasting films, was visited for the research. The Diplomatic Archives of Korea, with the help of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was visited to seek the documents in regard to communication between the Korean government and the WHO, as well as its external consultants and other public health organizations. We visited the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) and its Library to access to the hard copies of historical documents from the WHO and Korea. It holds documents relating to health promotion and education, vaccination and the practice and management that were conducted in Korea since the 1950s. The materials span the 70 years of the relation between the WHO and Korea.
index 4
data As the primary collection processes began, the Advisory Board Committee, comprised of public health society members from the 1960s to until now, was established to bring thoughts and insights together on defining the value to be presented by the book. Extensive on-line and off-line communications were made, shaping the vision, structure, contents, and the purpose of presenting the book.
index 5
data Semi-structured interviews were conducted, comprising more than 30 Korean and international personnel on public health, currently active or inactive. For former WHO-based public health workers who are living in hard-to-reach areas, e-mail interviews were conducted. For retired ex-members in the public health field who reside in Korea or the Philippines, on-site interviews were conducted. The knowledge and the ideas shared by the experts were then brought back to the Global Health Research Institute, and were incorporated into the value of the book.
index 6
data The writing team was comprised of historians and former members of the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Graduate school students at public health schools have organized the collected materials including related literature, interview notes and recordings, photos, and e-mails. Initial drafts written by historians were edited by the writing team. After several rounds of editing, the drafts were reviewed and reorganized by the Advisory Board Committee. Quarterly meetings hosted by the primary editor (Park NY) for reviewing were held during the development process. In 2015, a public hearing for the publication of the book was held with 10 currently active or inactive public health professionals from government, academia or health institutions. After the public hearing, the manuscripts, which were written in Korean, were translated into English by a professional English editing service. After translation, the English version of the draft was sent to the publication department of WPRO to be checked for consistency with the publication policy of the WHO.
index 7
data This publication reviews the history of cooperation between the Republic of Korea and WHO over last 70 years, highlighting key achievements and challenges in public health for the Republic of Korea and WHO. This history is divided into 4 chapters and they are as follows; 1) The origin of health services and WHO support in the Republic of Korea (1946–1960), 2) Enhancement of public health services in the Republic of Korea in cooperation with WHO (1961–1979), 3) Expansion of public health services in partnership with WHO (1980–1996), and 4) From recipient to donor: transition of the Republic of Korea and support of WHO (1997–2016).
index 8
data The relation between WHO and the Republic of Korea was started by Korean officials' participating in the International Health Conference in 1946 as observers, and the Republic of Korea became a Member State of the Western Pacific Region on 17 August 1949. WHO and the Government of the Republic of Korea concluded a basic agreement for the roles and responsibilities for the development of health services in the Republic of Korea on 1 September 1951. During the 1950s, WHO provided the Government with support on policy and technical issues, as well as capacity-building necessary to establish the foundation for a national public health system. During the 1960s and 1970s, WHO played a critical role in the advancement of health care in the Republic of Korea by supporting to a wide range of health programmes covering acute communicable diseases, leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria and parasites, maternal and child health, and environmental health. In 1962, WHO established a Country Liaison Office in Seoul and supported the training of public health workers through overseas fellowships and national training courses. During this period, the Republic of Korea began to contribute to global health including the activities of Korean experts in the WHO Secretariat and other developing countries, supplying dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) to Viet Nam, and establishing WHO collaborating center in Korea. Between 1980 and 1996, the Government of Republic of Korea gradually transformed itself from aid-recipient country to an emerging donor country. WHO also shifted its focus of support in the Republic of Korea from communicable diseases and maternal and child health programmes to emerging health issues such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer and environmental pollution. WHO focused on piloting the district health-care system based on primary health care, and building the capacity of public health officials with scholarships to graduate schools of public health in the Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea also expanded its support to WHO in terms of financial contributions and technical expertise. Several Korean experts in the field of medicine and nursing were deployed as WHO advisors to other Member states such as American Samoa, Papua New Guinea, Brunei Darussalam, and Kiribati to support the development of primary health-care services. From 1997 to 2016, the Republic of Korea made a transition from recipient to donor, and the WHO Office in the Republic of Korea was finally closed in 2012. However, the Republic of Korea has established a stronger cooperative relationship with WHO, becoming a member of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and signing on to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. WHO also continued the support in the selected areas including measles elimination, the development of a new tuberculosis control policy, the control of a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak and facilitating the Republic of Korea's support to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea's development allowed it to increase its financial contributions to WHO, establish the various WHO collaborating centers, and provide Korean experts to work with WHO. A growing number of WHO staff members from the Republic of Korea have worked at various levels of WHO including head-quarters, the Regional Office for the Western Pacific, and several WHO country offices (Cambodia, Fiji, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and Samoa). Lessons learnt in cooperation between the Republic of Korea and WHO can guide other nations through the transition from an aid recipient to a country that can contribute to regional and global health initiatives.
index 9
data The book was finalized with support of WPRO and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and a Korean version of this book will be available in the near future. This historical work would contribute to record current and future stories of public health in Korea.

data Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been long ago recognized as a systemic inflammatory entity and as such, it is anticipated to induce changes exceeding the boundaries of bowel mucosa, being reflected in a broader spectrum of tissues, including blood[1-7]. Examples of such changes are the fluctuations in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukins, S100 proteins, metalloproteinases, angiogenins, etc[4-7]. Since a different task is carried out by each of these biomarkers, it has been proposed that IBD induces multifarious responses which in turn, may affect the levels of different compounds via feedback mechanisms, consumption or reprioritisation of synthesis[4-8]. These observations along with the inflammatory nature of IBD itself seem to encourage the study of novel proteins that tend to become affected by the establishment of systemic inflammation[3,8]. Such a candidate is fetuin A or α2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG), a substance synthesized in the liver, bone marrow and fetal organs, exhibiting properties similar to those possessed by negative acute-phase proteins[9]. AHSG has been shown to carry out various immunologic tasks, including regulation of macrophage-related lipopolysaccharide-triggered opsonisation, TNF-α and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) levels[10-13]. AHSG is also an inhibitor of ectopic tissue calcification such as that taking place in coronary arteries and heart valves, while at the same time promoting mineralization within fibrils and subsequently, proper bone formation[13-15]. Other recently discovered properties of AHSG include a binding ability to insulin receptor, modifying its sensitivity, participation in wound healing as well as tumor growth processes, through the induction of a more effective cell migration[8,9]. Increased AHSG levels have been recorded in fetal organs (probably reflecting an additional role for AHSG in normal organ development), in adults with either metabolic syndrome or increased insulin resistance alone, patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus as well as individuals at high risk for future cardiovascular events: stroke and acute myocardial infarction[8,9,16]. Low levels of AHSG have been recorded in patients on hemodialysis, those with cirrhosis, hepatoma or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an entity sharing common inflammatory pathways with IBD, and have been linked to vascular - excessive valvular and coronary artery calcification, ischemic events- and skeletal disorders - osteopenia[14,17,18]. Moreover, similar phenomena: upregulation of TNF-α and TGF-β, remodelling in intestinal microvessels, both on an acute and chronic basis, as well as manifestations linked to mineral homeostasis i.e., osteoporosis and urolithiasis, are all exerted in IBD. When bearing in mind these characteristics, the idea of examining AHSG levels in IBD, seems more than tempting[4,19-23].

data Among several patients visiting ER wards, outpatient clinics or being hospitalised for chronic diarrhea, a total of 242 patients were recruited: 96 diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC), 84 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 62 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). All patients were followed for a minimum period of 3 years at the Department of Gastroenterology at the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. Another group consisting of 180 healthy individuals was also formed (HC). Study groups were age and sex matched (P > 0.05) with one exception: the CD and UC groups, differed significantly (P = 0.002) as anticipated, since CD is often associated with younger age. All individuals participating in the study lacked any known disease i.e., end-stage renal disease, RA, cirrhosis, hepatoma, liver metastases potentially affecting AHSG levels, with the exception of diabetes mellitus (DM), which was treated as a confounding factor and was embedded in the models used for multivariate testing. The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients and HC are presented in Table 1.
index 1
data The diagnosis of IBD and IBS was established upon the co-evaluation of findings originating from clinical and endoscopic procedures, imaging studies, histopathology and laboratory analyses. IBS patients were also diagnosed and classified as D-IBS or M-IBS (40 and 22 individuals, respectively) according to the Rome III criteria[24]. Disease activity in the IBD group was documented using conventional indices: Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Clinical Activity Index (CAI), for UC[25,26]. A CDAI score greater than 150 and a CAI score exceeding 4, on a 0-16 scale, were considered as active CD and active UC, respectively. Disease location and behavior, in CD, were determined using the Vienna classification whereas for disease extent, in UC, the Montreal classification was used[27,28]. No animals were used for the present study.
index 2
data Blood samples were collected upon presentation of patients in our hospital, in serum separator tubes and were allowed to clot for 30 min. All samples were then centrifuged and the obtained serum was stored at -25 °C for later analysis. The pre-analytical phase, including sampling and handling methods (sampling tubes, storage conditions etc.) was identical in all cases.
index 3
data AHSG assay: For AHSG determinations, a two-site "sandwich" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed, using a commercially available human Fetuin A ELISA kit (BioSource Europe SA, Belgium). Assay calibrators, controls and prediluted patient serum samples (10 μL initially) containing human AHSG were added to microplate wells, coated with a high affinity polyclonal goat anti-human AHSG antibody. During incubation period, the antibody could capture human AHSG in the sample. Unbound proteins were then washed away and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated polyclonal anti-human AHSG antibody was added to each well, so that a "sandwich" of "capture antibody-human AHSG-HRP conjugated detecting antibody" could be formed. After additional washing, incubation with a substrate solution took place, the reaction was stopped and the developed colour was quantified spectrophotometrically. The enzymatic activity of the detecting antibodies, bound to the AHSG on the wall of the microwells, was directly proportional to the amount of AHSG in the sample. A calibration curve which was generated by plotting the absorbance vs the respective human AHSG concentration for each calibrator, allowed sample AHSG determination.
index 4
data C-reactive protein assay: For the determination of C-reactive protein (CRP), immunonephelometry was performed using the Behring Nephelometer Analyzer II, as well as the N High Sensitivity commercially available kit (Dade Behring Gmbh, Germany). The control and standard sera were provided by the same company and used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
index 5
data Anti-glycan antibodies assay: Serum levels of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies (gASCA) IgG, anti-mannobioside carbohydrate antibodies (AMCA) IgG, anti-laminariobioside carbohydrate antibodies (ALCA) IgG and anti-chitobioside carbohydrate antibodies (ACCA) IgA were also determined in 108 IBD (56 CD and 52 UC) patients, using commercially available ELISA kits (IBDX, Glycominds Ltd., Israel). Cut-off levels for positivity were set at 50, 100, 60, and 90 U/mL for gASCA IgG, AMCA IgG, ALCA IgG, and ACCA IgA, respectively, as instructed by the manufacturer.
index 6
data Normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) test was initially carried out and since the normality assumption was satisfied for the comparison of means between two groups, Student's t-tests were used. For comparisons between multiple groups, one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests were applied. Variables are expressed as mean ± SD or mean ± SE. For variables without comparable variations, Welch's correction has been applied. AHSG was tested for its ability to predict IBD, UC and CD, separately, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, while area under the curve (AUC) and cut-off values, with the optimal sensitivity and specificity, were also calculated. For the simple correlation studies, Pearson's rank test was used. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Whenever statistical significance or trend (0.05 < P < 0.1) was recorded in univariate analysis, multivariate testing was also performed. Using multiple linear regression and a backward selection process independent variables affecting AHSG levels - confounders - were identified. As candidate confounding factors were initially considered age, sex, smoking, DM, treatment modalities, disease duration and behaviour, age at onset. For the associations originating from multiple linear regression, partial correlation coefficients - quantifying the relationship between two variables while controlling for other factors- are reported. Whenever a categorical parameter was treated as dependent variable, logistic regression analyses, simple and multiple, were applied and odds ratios (ORs) as well as 95%CIs, unadjusted/adjusted for confounding, were calculated. Adjusted means were also calculated using analysis of covariance. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (4.0 and 7.0) and the MedCalc 10.2.0.0 statistical softwares. Statistical review of the study was performed by a biostatistician.
index 7
data The study was approved by the University of Thessaly Medical School Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants, along with a verbal permission for the use of the acquired samples for scientific research.
index 8
data The mean ± SE of AHSG in serum was 0.33 ± 0.01 g/L for IBD, 0.73 ± 0.02 g/L for IBS patients and 0.7 ± 0.02 g/L for HC. The recorded difference between the IBD and control groups was statistically significant (P < 0.0001) and this was also the case when CD and UC were compared separately with IBS patients and HC. AHSG levels in the CD group were 0.31 ± 0.01 g/L, significantly lower than those of IBS patients and HC (P < 0.0001). Likewise, UC patients also exhibited lower AHSG levels (0.34 ± 0.01 g/L) compared to IBS patients and HC (P < 0.001). These differences remained significant between IBD (0.32 ± 0.02 g/L), CD (0.32 ± 0.03 g/L) or UC patients (0.34 ± 0.03 g/L), IBS patients (0.7 ± 0.018 g/L) and HC (0.71 ± 0.02 g/L), after adjustment for age and sex (P < 0.001, for all comparisons). When AHSG levels were compared between UC and CD patients or between IBS patients and HC, no significant differences were observed (P > 0.05, in both cases) (Figure 1).
index 9
data ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off of AHSG for the prediction of IBD was 0.44 g/L (90% sensitivity and specificity). Similarly, an AHSG value of 0.44 g/L could distinguish CD patients from non-IBD individuals (IBS and HC) with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 90.6%, while a value of 0.42 g/L could discriminate UC patients and non-IBD subjects with 91.7% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity. The AUC was 0.94 (95%CI: 0.91-0.97), 0.94 (95%CI: 0.91-0.97) and 0.95 (95%CI: 0.92-0.98) for the prediction of IBD, UC and CD, respectively (P < 0.0001, in all cases) (Figure 2).
index 10
data All IBD patients exhibited active disease when blood was drawn for later analysis. In our study, in patients with active disease the AHSG levels were marginally associated with CDAI and CAI scores (r = -0.24, P = 0.08). When disease location (CD) and extent (UC) were taken under consideration no statistically significant differences were observed (P > 0.05 in all cases).
index 11
data Another part of the present study included the comparison of AHSG serum concentrations among CD patients with diverse disease behavior: stricturing, penetrating and non-stricturing non-penetrating (ns/np). The performed analysis showed that patients with stricturing or penetrating disease had lower AHSG levels (0.26 ± 0.07 g/L and 0.26 ± 0.06 g/L, respectively), compared to patients in the ns/np subgroup (0.33 ± 0.07 g/L). These differences were statistically significant between CD patients with stricturing and ns/np (P < 0.01) or between the penetrating and ns/np disease subgroup (P < 0.001) but not between the stricturing and penetrating subgroups (P > 0.05) (Figure 3). Further analysis verified the inverse association between AHSG and penetrating, as well as stricturing CD, both before (r = -0.44 and -0.32, respectively, P < 0.05), as well as after adjustment (partial correlation coefficient: -0.45 and -0.33, respectively, P < 0.05) for age, sex and smoking status. In order to perform additional testing of the link between lower AHSG levels and complicated disease behavior, logistic regression was applied, while considering penetrating or stricturing CD, as dependent, and AHSG concentrations, in quartiles - lowest, low, high, highest - as independent variables. The results originating from this analysis showed that AHSG levels, in the lowest quartile, were associated with both penetrating as well as stricturing disease, before (OR = 4.25, 95%CI: 1.54-11.8 and OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.1-8.31, respectively) and after adjustment (OR = 8.36, 95%CI: 2.57-27.17 and OR = 3.5, 95%CI: 1.47-12.9, respectively) for age, sex and smoking status (P < 0.01, in all cases).
index 12
data AHSG levels were also examined with respect to the presence of one or more IBD-related extraintestinal manifestations. IBD patients exhibiting extraintestinal manifestations had comparable AHSG levels (0.32 ± 0.01 g/L) to the IBD subgroup without such disorders (0.33 ± 0.01 g/L, P = 0.55). Interestingly, 11 IBD patients with a history of recurrent urolithiasis had AHSG levels at the lowest quartile, this result, however, did not reach statistical significance. All data on AHSG variations according to the already described disease characteristics are presented in Table 2.
index 13
data The levels of serum AHSG were studied with respect to gender of IBD patients, so that potential differences could be highlighted. Both male and female IBD patients exhibited comparable AHSG levels (0.32 ± 0.01 g/L and 0.33 ± 0.01 g/L, respectively) (P = 0.53). Likewise, AHSG levels were similar between IBD patients, while taking into account age at onset and smoking habits (Table 3).
index 14
data Serum AHSG concentrations were examined with regard to treatment modalities adequate for inducing and maintaining remission during the 3-year follow up period: 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-TNFα agents or surgery. During comparison, IBD patients requiring surgical intervention or the use of anti-TNFα therapy exhibited lower AHSG concentrations (0.26 ± 0.07 g/L and 0.3 ± 0.05 g/L), compared to those adequately treated with 5-ASA (0.33 ± 0.05 g/L) or corticosteroids (0.35 ± 0.1 g/L) (P < 0.05, in both cases). Further evaluation of the recorded associations, using simple linear regression analysis, showed that AHSG levels were inversely associated with the need for anti-TNFα treatment (r = -0.31, P < 0.05) and surgery (r = -0.36, P < 0.05). After multivariate analysis - also considering age, sex, activity, duration, smoking status- the inverse association between AHSG and need for anti-TNFα therapy or surgery remained statistically significant (partial correlation coefficients: -0.33 and -0.41, respectively - P < 0.05, in both cases). Since these results are suggestive of a link between a more profound downregulation of AHSG levels and the need for anti-TNFα treatment or surgical intervention, AHSG concentrations were classified into quartiles. Using logistic regression, AHSG levels in the lowest quartile were found to be an independent predictor of the need for anti-TNFα treatment, in a model adjusted for other treatment modalities, age, sex, smoking status and disease duration (OR = 5.22, 95%CI: 1.58-17.3, P < 0.01). Similarly, by applying the same adjusted model, it was shown that need for surgery could be independently predicted by the presence of AHSG levels within the lowest quartile (OR = 5.51, 95%CI: 1.11-27.3, P < 0.01).
index 15
data IBD patients had higher CRP levels (median: 3.2 mg/dL, range: 0.9-29.3 mg/dL) compared to IBS (median: 1.05 mg/dL, range: 0-4.3 mg/dL) and HC groups (median: 0.9 mg/dL, range: 0-2.8 mg/dL) (P < 0.001). A correlation study of AHSG with the levels of the inflammatory marker CRP was performed revealing marginal association (r = -0.28, P = 0.07). Multivariate analysis, considering as confounding variables age, sex and smoking on the other hand, revealed a closer association between the two substances with a -0.31 partial correlation coefficient and a P = 0.02 level of significance.
index 16
data Positivity rates for serological markers were 18% for gASCA, 25.6% for ALCA, 5% for AMCA and ALCA while actual median concentrations are presented in Table 4. Additional associations were investigated by examining positivity for these serological markers and AHSG (in quartiles). Interestingly, an inverse association between serology and AHSG levels was recorded. IBD individuals who were seropositive, for at least one marker, had AHSG levels falling within the two lower quartiles (OR = 2.87, 95%CI: 1.51-5.45, P < 0.001) while those with at least two serological markers positive exhibited AHSG concentrations within the lowest quartile (OR = 5.12, 95%CI: 2.17-12.08, P < 0.001). Further analysis also considering potential confounding factors such as age, sex and smoking did not alter the reported associations significantly: OR = 2.86 (95%CI: 1.5-5.44) for single and OR = 5.03 (95%CI: 2.07-12.21) for multiple seropositivity (P < 0.001, in both cases).
index 17
data In accordance with a preliminary report from our team in 2010, AHSG levels were downregulated in patients with IBD thus, allowing discrimination from IBS and HC individuals[29]. Furthermore, a more profound downregulation of AHSG was very well associated with complicated disease behavior and the need for biological anti-TNFα treatment or surgery. Additional associations with CRP and anti-glycan antibodies offered better insight into AHSG's link with acute-phase response and IBD course.
index 18
data The finding of an IBD-induced downregulation of AHSG is nothing but surprising since, AHSG levels decrease in the presence of robust inflammation[9,11,18]. Moreover, an interplay had already been documented between AHSG and the "notorious", in IBD, TNF-α and TGF-β[11-13]. An additional finding further confirming the tight link of AHSG with TNFα, was the discovery of a binding site for TNFα, within the AHSG gene. As a consequence of TNFα's binding on this region, the expression of AHSG gene is suppressed, leading to decreased AHSG production while other substances are favored-repriorisation of liver synthesis[8,11-13]. Due to the magnitude and rather IBD-selective character of this suppression, however, an evaluation of AHSG's ability to differentiate between entities has been performed. When a cut-off of 0.44 g/L was used, AHSG levels were shown to discriminate IBD from IBS and HC with a sensitivity and specificity of 90%.
index 19
data When magnitude of disease activity, as expressed through CDAI and CAI scores, was taken into consideration marginal differences were detected. According to the study by Ma et al[30] significant differences in AHSG levels exist between IBD patients with active or inactive disease. On the other hand, a correlation between AHSG and CRP was confirmed, in our study. This may be, at least in part, due to limitations of the indices themselves although one should bear in mind that apart from the negative acute phase protein properties attributed to AHSG, its downregulation is also a part of a more complex liver deregulation, resulting from an excessive uptake and processing of signals[8-18]. Perhaps, possible associations of AHSG with other indices should also be evaluated[31-32]. At this point, however, an asset of the present study has to be underlined: the AHSG levels recorded in IBD patients correspond to a prior-to-therapy status and therefore, could not have been altered by any of the known drugs used to treat IBD.
index 20
data A different set of results was obtained while examining AHSG levels with respect to UC extent and CD location. The recorded AHSG levels in this study could not predict disease location or extent and therefore, could not be used for this purpose.
index 21
data This was not the case when disease behavior was taken into account. A further downregulation of AHSG was observed, in CD patients with stricturing or penetrating disease, compared to those with the ns/np subtype. This is not surprising as a more diffuse transmural inflammation would exert a stronger proinflammatory effect[33]. Moreover, in many organs inflammatory stress leads to fibrosis and subsequently tissue calcification[34]. From another pathogenetic perspective, a reason for the observed link between AHSG and stricturing disease could also be the reduced AHSG-induced counteraction of TGF-β's fibrogenic and antiproliferative potential[12,13,19]. Likewise, microvascular calcification, reduced blood flow and microthrombosis, exerted phenomena in the presence of low AHSG levels are also major findings during a chronic phase in the intestinal vasculature of IBD patients, leading to diminished intestinal perfusion and in turn to ulceration and fibrosis[21,35].
index 22
data Another scopus of the present study was to test whether there is a link between AHSG levels and the presence of extraintestinal manifestations. The performed analysis did not reveal any associations between AHSG serum concentration and the presence of any extraintestinal manifestations. In this case, a limitation exists: the rather small number of IBD patients manifesting specific disorders i.e., urolithiasis.
index 23
data A study focusing on the characteristics of IBD patients and AHSG levels was also performed. AHSG concentrations were compared among patients of different gender, smoking status and age at onset. None of these characteristics - male or female sex, current smoking or non-smoking habit and age at onset- could be linked with significant AHSG variations.
index 24
data This was not the case when AHSG levels were evaluated with respect to treatment modalities adequately inducing and sustaining disease remission during the three-year follow-up period. A robust downregulation of AHSG levels correlated with the need for anti-TNFα therapy. This finding is within reason since, a more profound and persisting upregulation of TNFα, requiring subsequently the use of an anti-TNFα agent, would result in a greater AHSG decrease. As far as the link between AHSG levels and need for surgery, is concerned, one should also bear in mind that this subgroup predominantly consisted of CD patients with stricturing and penetrating disease. In the case of a refractory UC, requiring colectomy, safe conclusions could not be drawn due to the small number of colectomised patients, in our study.
index 25
data The evidence mentioned above seems to make rather appealing the idea of AHSG's use as a diagnostic or even "predictive" tool rather tightly linked to IBD behavior as well as with markers related to it, such as the anti-glycan antibodies[36]. A prerequisite for this type of use is that its lack of a disease-specific nature, with similar fluctuations also reported in other disorders, is taken into account[9,14,17,18]. A combined clinical and AHSG-based algorithm for the diagnosis of IBD, on the other hand, could help overcome this limitation.
index 26
data Setting aside the already-performed diagnostically-oriented interpretation of current results, a careful examination of AHSG's potential implication in the pathogenesis and complications of IBD, should also be performed. As already mentioned, AHSG is an inhibitor of unwanted, ectopic, tissue calcification and its decreased levels, as in this case, have been linked with excessive valvular and arterial calcification[4]. Although, initial reports originated from animal studies and those recruiting dialysis patients, similar results were obtained in patients with ischemic heart disease, alone[37]. Since a decrease in circulating AHSG is present in IBD, it would be logical to hypothesize that an accompanying reduced inhibition of vascular and valvular calcification would also be present. As this study was not designed to "tackle" these matters, the actual contribution of low AHSG levels in vascular changes and related acute or chronic ischemic events in IBD[38], remains to be clarified.
index 27
data Apart from the implication of AHSG in vascular pathology, another role, that of bone mineralisation has been identified[13-15]. Under the influence of AHSG, a "reliable", stress-resistant bone structure is formed, while in the absence of AHSG, minerals deposit outside fibrils, leading to defective osseous formation and finally osteoporosis[15]. As IBD patients are at high risk for osteoporosis, resulting from corticosteroids, malnutrition and inflammation-induced osteopenia[22] the examination of possible contribution of AHSG suppression for the onset of osteopenic manifestations might prove fruitful. In a rather similar manner, a defective coordination in mineral use, predominantly that of calcium, due to decreased AHSG levels, may lead to urolithiasis. Indeed, in the study of Stejskal et al[39] lower levels of AHSG in urine have been associated with the presence of urolithiasis. Although, in the case of IBD, well-established mechanisms- i.e., hyperoxaluria, reduced citric acid etc[18] - for urinary compications exist, when bearing in mind that still 80% of urinary stones consist of calcium salts it is within reason to test for additional candidates involved in calcium homeostasis and urinary manifestations, such as AHSG[40].
index 28
data Conclusively, AHSG seems to emerge as a molecule of potential diagnostic and perhaps predictive value in IBD, as its downregulation shows a tight link with acute-phase. As well as with chronic inflammatory responses in both CD and UC. This link also encompasses the more challenging cases, those with complicated disease behavior, as well as those requiring advanced treatment strategies such as biological agents or surgery. As far as the pathogenetic role of AHSG in IBD is concerned, further studies designed to assess the impact and the association of low AHSG levels with respect to micro- and macro-vascular changes, skeletal and urinary complications recorded in patients with CD and UC, are needed.

data α2-Heremans-schmid glycoprotein (AHSG/fetuin A), a negative acute-phase protein with multiple functions, becomes downregulated in the presence of inflammation.
index 31
data An AHSG downregulation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients has been initially reported by our research team in 2010. Another independent study, later verified this result. A major confounding factor, that of IBD-specific treatment existed in both studies.
index 32
data This is the first study assessing AHSG levels in treatment-naive patients. The low levels of AHSG found in IBD patients are not recorded in control subjects-IBS patients and healthy controls- and are well-associated with complicated disease behavior, as well as the need for anti-TNFα treatment or surgery. Additional links with the acute phase protein C-reactive protein and serological markers linked to IBD course, the anti-glycan antibodies, have been found.
index 33
data AHSG could serve as an additional marker for IBD diagnosis and prediction of a more challenging course requiring treatment with biological agents or surgery, during the three-year period following initial diagnosis.
index 34
data The paper is valuable. It finds AHSG can be used to distinguish between IBD and irritable bowel syndrome, and may predict complicated disease behavior, and foretell the need for intensified therapy and surgery. Moreover, AHSG may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of IBD.

data As is well-known, osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONFH) is a debilitating disorder with a considerably high incidence in the young and middle-aged (from the 20s to age 50), and consequently brings huge economic burden around the world.[1,2] Approximately 20,000 patients were estimated to develop ONFH in America every year and another survey showed that the annul morbidity of ONFH in Japan was about 2.51/10,000.[3,4] It is histologically characterized by insufficient supply of blood, death of osteocytes and bone marrow cells, and progressive structure damage of involved bones. Although osteonecrosis only affects the femoral head in most cases, osteonecrosis of other sites, for example, joints of knee, shoulder, wrist, elbow, and ankle also could be seen on clinic. The etiology of osteonecrosis is of various risk factors such as trauma, surgery of hip, corticosteroids, alcoholism, systemic lupus erythematosus, sickle-cell disease, and coagulopathy;[5] however, usually osteonecrotic lesions possess similar pathophysiological alteration.
index 0
data Multiple options are available for treating ONFH. Surgical treatment methods include core decompression (CD), conversion osteotomy, bone transplants with or without vascular pedicles, total hip arthroplasty (THA) and so on; however, modalities such as weight bearing restriction, alendronate, anticoagulant drugs, lipid-lowering agents and extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) are employed as noninvasive and biophysical alternatives to solve this challenging disease.[6–9] ESWT was introduced into the medical field after World War II, targeted at managing urinary calculus first and subsequently incidental phenomena that pelvic bone density increased during lithotripsy intrigued orthopedists to apply extracorporeal shockwave to treat musculoskeletal disorders.[10] A amount of studies investigated the effect of ESWT in the treatment of ONFH but high-quality evidence about its mechanism and effectiveness is still urgently needed. CD with/without bone grafting remains the gold standard for hip-salvage treatment.
index 1
data One systematic review (SR) published in 2009 collected related clinical researches in this field and drew a favorable result. However, this SR only included 5 studies, one of which was case report and another 4 were presented by same medical center.[11] Besides, more literatures on this topic were published in recent years, in which the clinical effect of ESWT was assessed from a more comprehensive perspective and compared with other therapeutic methods. In order to further elucidate this issue and provide reference for clinicians, we included existing clinical evidences so far and made this updated systematic review about the effect of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in the treatment of osteonecrosis of femoral head.
index 2
data For the purpose of collecting potentially eligible publications, we made a computerized search in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library using the following terms: (shock wave OR shockwave OR ESWT) and (osteonecrosis OR avascular necrosis OR aseptic necrosis) by 2 investigators (Zhang QY and Liu LH) independently. No time limitations were imposed and the last search was performed on July 31, 2016. Reference lists of relevant articles were also screened manually to retrieve any additionally possible records.
index 3
data Studies eligible for this systematic review need to meet following criteria: (1) patients diagnosed with ONFH, (2) ESWT was applied to at least part of patients, (3) adequate data were provided to assess the therapeutic effect (e.g., visual analog scores, Harris score, ARCO stage), and (4) the types of included studies contained prospective or retrospective cohort, open label trial, randomized controlled trial, case-control study and case report. If data overlapped in different articles, we only included the most comprehensive or most recent one. Using these predesigned criteria, apparently ineligible articles were first excluded by screening titles and abstracts. The remainders were downloaded and then assessed by scrutinizing the full texts.
index 4
data Requisite data extracted from original articles and then recorded to standardized excel files included: surname of first author, publication year, number and age and gender of participants, number of affected hips, ARCO stage, technological details of ESWT, evaluation indicators and inclusion period. Quality of included studies was appraised by using Oxford Centre for evidence-based medicine (EBM) Levels of Evidence, in which clinical evidences could be grossly divided to 5 levels ranging from I to V and each level could be subdivided. Ia represents the highest-quality evidence and V is the lowest.[12] Any disagreement was resolved through discussion and consensus of investigators.
index 5
data Because all data in this article were retrieved from published studies, neither ethical approval nor patient consent was required.
index 6
data In 2001, Ludwig and his coauthors[13] first suggested that high-energy extracorporeal shockwave might provide a noninvasive alternative for treating ONFH. In this study, a total of 22 patients with ONFH of ARCO I–III stage received 1 (or 2 if necessary) session of ESWT and were followed up for 1 year. The results revealed obvious therapeutic success in 14 patients, in which group patients scored statistically differently at ARCO scale and showed slightly heterogeneous (though not statistically significant) age distribution compared with those resistant to ESWT. Meanwhile, 4 cases of complete healing were observed on MRI. Kong et al[22] supported this conclusion. In their study, 36 ONFH patients involving 42 hips were enrolled and at 1-year follow-up, they declared that cure was observed in 6 hips, marked effect in 13 hips, effectiveness in 16 hips, and ineffectiveness in 7 hips. It must be pointed out that in this study they did not undertake MRI examination and the definition of cure was disappearance of clinical symptoms. In 2012, Vulpiani et al[23] performed a further study by including 36 patients with unilateral ONFH and grouping them according to the ARCO scale. At the same time, the follow-up was extended to 24 months. This study demonstrated that the therapeutic results achieved by ESWT were significantly associated with ARCO stage of patients. ONFH of ARCO stage III responded poorly to ESWT and 10 of the 15 patients had to receive THA during the follow-up. Meanwhile, though clinical symptoms of certain patients were improved, no or only minimal improvement of lesions was observed on plain films or MRIs at all follow-up points. Lee et al's study[29] also divided patients on the basis of ARCO stage and obtained similar results. Kusz et al[24] demonstrated considerable enhancement of quality of life in ONFH patients after ESWT; however, they only followed up patients for 6 weeks. In the study reported by Gao et al,[26] they presented the largest patient population on this topic. A total of 335 patients involving 528 hips were divided into 2 groups according to whether the lateral pillar of femoral head was preserved and both groups showed amelioration of pain, increase of Harris hip scores and slowing of disease progression. They pointed out that the improvement of Harris hip scores was mainly due to the reduction of pains and the lesion decrease on MRI after ESWT was not statistically significant (at the same time, a significant reduction of bone marrow edema was indeed observed). Above-mentioned studies used focused shockwave while in 2016, Ma et al[28] described a case of advanced ONFH opt not to THA and treated with radial ESWT, in which a satisfactory result was obtained. Larger-scale clinical trials are needed to confirm this conclusion.
index 7
data Two studies including a case reported by Lin et al[15] in 2006 and a case series presented by Wang et al[20] in 2009 investigated the use of ESWT in ONFH patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and receiving corticosteroids therapy. In Lin et al's article,[15] at 3-year follow-up after ESWT, pain and motor function of bilateral hips of the young ONFH patient were improved and no further progression was observed on MRI. Wang et al's study[20] recruited 1 group of ONFH patients with SLE and another group without SLE, both receiving 6000 impulses of ESWT and then followed up for 3 years. The results revealed that therapeutic effects of 2 groups had no significant difference (P = 0.802, 0.467 and 0.194 for THR, pain scores and function scores, respectively).
index 8
data Wong et al treated 4 ONFH patients involving 8 hips with cocktail therapy consisting of ESWT, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) and alendronate.[16] All participants were healthcare workers suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and had been treated with corticosteroids. At 4-year follow-up, 4 patients returned to work without the need for THA. No improvement or progression of ARCO stage was observed during follow-up.
index 9
data The therapy of leukemia and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are accompanied with a markedly elevated risk of ONFH. Sun et al[27] recruited 43 ONFH patients with leukemia and justified similar therapeutic effect of ESWT in these patients compared with other ONFH patients. Only 2 hips showed progressive femoral head collapse and accepted THA eventually.
index 10
data In Wang et al's study,[14] 48 ONFH patients with 57 hips were randomized to receive either ESWT or joint-preserving surgery (core decompression and bone-grafting). Participants from 2 groups possessed homogeneous characteristics as well as VAS and Harris hip scores at baseline. At about 2-year follow-up, the ESWT group yielded better outcome in pain relief, Harris scores, hip function in activities of daily living and imaging manifestations. In 2012, Wang et al[25] published a further investigation comparing curative effect of ESWT with core decompression plus autogenous cancellous bone and allogenous fibular graft, and in this study they extended the follow-up to 8- or 9-year. At the last follow-up point, the ratios of good/poor response to treatment were 76/24 and 21/79 in ESWT group and CD group, respectively; meanwhile, THA was applied to 24% and 64% patients in ESWT group and CD group, respectively. Chen and his coworkers included 17 patients with bilateral ONFH, and then treated 17 hips with THA for late disease and other hips with ESWT for early disease.[19] According to the subjective evaluation after treatment, ESWT was valued more highly than THA in 13 patients and believed to be similar to THA in 4 cases. This result indicated that early detection of ONFH was crucial for its management.
index 11
data Whether a synergistic effect of ESWT and other conservative treatments exists was investigated in 2 literatures. In the study published by Wang et al in 2008, they randomly divided 48 patients to 2 groups, receiving ESWT with and without alendronate, respectively.[18] Eventually, the overall clinical outcomes of 2 curative groups were comparable. The differences of pain and functional enhancement between 2 groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.400 and 0.313, respectively). Hsu et al[21] further combined ESWT, alendronate and HBO to treat early ONFH, and this time, a better result of cocktail therapy than ESWT alone was still not testified. Eventually, 10% patients in the cocktail group and 10.4% patients in the ESWT group had to receive THR (P = 0.946).
index 12
data In 2008, Wang et al[17] published a article included 14 patients involving 14 diseased hips graded as ARCO stage III or IV, all of which underwent THA. 7 cases also received ESWT before surgery and others were regarded as control group. ESWT group revealed more live bone and less necrotic bone as well as higher cell concentration and activity compared with control group. Factors for angiogenesis such as von Willebrand factor (vWF), CD31, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) as well as for bone remodeling and regeneration such as Winless 3a (Wnt 3), Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) also had significant differences between ESWT group and control group. These findings prompted the regeneration effects of ESWT to ONFH.
index 13
data Total hip arthroplasty has become a mature and reliable operation to remove clinical symptoms of advanced osteonecrosis of femoral head. However, constant need for joint-preserving treatment modalities yielding satisfactory result is still imperative, especially for patients with early ONFH. Until now, the efficacy of most nonsurgical therapeutic methods for ONFH remains disputable, which made them not ready for widely recommendation. In recent several decades, ESWT has been applied to various kinds of musculoskeletal disorders including proximal plantar fascitis, lateral epicondylitis of the elbow, nonunion and delayed union of long bone fracture and so on.[33] As a common disabling disorder, ONFH was also investigated for the effect of ESWT by multiple studies.
index 14
data We made this SR for the purpose of providing a higher quality evidence to physicians interested in this topic. Eventually, a total of 17 studies were retrieved and remarkable benefits of extracorporeal shockwave for treating ONFH were found to be consistent in included articles. Meanwhile, most included studies only investigated ONFH of ARCO stage I–III; therefore caution should be taken in applying these results and choosing appropriate indications.
index 15
data As previously mentioned, multiple risk factors could be the etiology of ONFH. In our systematic review, there were 4 studies which investigated the effect of ESWT in ONFH patients with SLE, SARS and leukemia after allo-HSCT.[15,16,20,27] At last, similar effectiveness of ESWT in these certain groups of patients with those indiscriminately recruiting various kinds of ONFH patients was observed. This finding indicated that ESWT could be conducted without considering the risk factors of ONFH.
index 16
data The exact mechanism of ESWT in the treatment of ONFH is still controversial. High-energy extracorporeal shockwave travels through soft tissue and the change of impedance between soft tissue and bone interface results in energy deposition. This energy deposition of high acoustic waves may explain part of the therapeutic effect of extracorporeal shockwave. Meanwhile, extracorporeal shockwave has the ability to propagate through necrotic femoral hips and at the depth of 10 mm of bone, a pressure loss of 50% of shockwave was observed.[30] One hypothesis is that ESWT could induce microfracture to accelerate bone healing and increase pain threshold.[10] Higher expression level of bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2, vessel endothelial growth factor (VEGF), alkaline phosphatase, Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and osteocalcin mRNA in marrow stromal cells as well as more mature mineralized nodules were demonstrated in ESWT group compared with control group, in which nitric oxide acted as the mediator.[31] One study showed increased osteogenesis and angiogenesis as well as bone remodeling of diseased hips after ESWT, indicating a regeneration effect.[17,32,33] In experiments with rabbit model, the expression of VEGF, BMP-2 and corresponding mRNA in subchondral bone of necrotic femoral heads was significantly up-regulated, which was consistent with the results in human samples.[34,35]
index 17
data Durst et al reported that a woman with calcific tendinitis received high-energy extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, and about 3 and a half years later she was diagnosed with osteonecrosis of humeral head.[36] Liu et al[37] presented another similar case report in which the onset of osteonecrosis of humeral head occurred only 3 months after ESWT. It is supposed that the high dose of extracorporeal shockwave and relatively small diameter of anterior humeral circumflex in 2 case reports might explain these complications. Though no evident complications of ESWT for treating ONFH was revealed, deterioration of lesions did be observed in some cases. Therefore, before starting ESWT, important arteries and nerves ought to be located with ultrasonography to avoid any possible damage. It is believed that radial ESWT has no need for location in advance but collection of high-quality data is necessary to testify this assumption.
index 18
data There were several limitations existing in our research. First, the evidence quality of our included studies was various. Only 4 studies were classified as Ib evidence according to Oxford Centre for EBM Levels of Evidence. Second, this is a systematic review and we could only discuss issues based on existing clinical evidences. Third, due to limited number of studies, quantitative analysis (meta-analysis) of extracted data is impossible. Finally, populations of most included studies were very small.
index 19
data This SR also reminds us of several research directions in the future. Persisting histopathological or even genetic experiments are indispensable to further clarify the mechanism of ESWT in the treatment of ONFH. Meanwhile, charging voltage, energy intensity, focus size, number of session and impulse of extracorporeal shockwave adopted by included studies were heterogeneous; therefore, a standardized therapeutic schedule of ESWT for ONFH needs to be determined. Last but not least, it is urgent for clinicians to discover other effective conservative modalities which could be applied to ONFH alone or enhance the benefits of ESWT.
index 20
data In a word, extracorporeal shockwave therapy provides a conservative modality to improve the motor function and relieve the pain of patients with osteonecrosis of femoral head. It possesses advantages such as non-invasiveness, safety, convenience to conduct and economy. Imaging revealed that bone marrow edema was significantly relieved but the necrotic bone or femoral head collapse could not be reversed after ESWT. This technique could slow or even block the progression of ONFH and therefore reduce the demand for surgery. ESWT brings more benefits than core decompression with/without bone grafting for early-stage ONFH and there is no evidence revealing that collaboration with other conservative methods could improve the curative effects of ESWT. Meanwhile, ONFH with various risk factors showed similar reaction to this noninvasive treatment method. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted carefully due to the low quality of included publications and further studies are requisite to validate the effect of ESWT in ONFH.

data This study was conducted as a prospective longitudinal observational study.
index 0
data Privately owned dogs diagnosed with BP between March 2011 and December 2012 at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Helsinki were eligible for inclusion in the study. Dogs with known or suspected concurrent infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic diseases capable of increasing APP concentrations were excluded from the study. Dogs with known excess endogenous glucocorticoids or glucocorticoid medication <4 weeks before BP were excluded from the Hp measurements.35, 36 Pregnant or lactating bitches and puppies <3 months of age also were excluded.37 Privately owned blood donor dogs were recruited as healthy controls for the APP measurements. These dogs had no signs of illness and had a normal physical examination findings as well as normal hematology and biochemistry findings.
index 1
data A full clinical examination was performed, and thoracic radiographs as well as blood, fecal, and respiratory samples were obtained at presentation as previously described.18 Thoracic radiographs were assessed by the same radiologist (AKL), who was blinded to the patient data. Bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed when typical acute signs (at least 3 of the following: fever, lethargy, dyspnea, tachypnea, cough) were observed and thoracic radiograph findings were compatible with BP (ie, an alveolar pattern or a moderate or severe bronchointerstitial or interstitial pattern).2, 3, 6 A bacterial origin was demonstrated by respiratory cytology or bacterial culture as previously described.18 A postmortem examination was performed on dogs that died or were euthanized during hospitalization, to confirm the diagnosis of BP.
index 2
data After initial examination, dogs were examined daily during hospitalization (clinical examination and individually chosen methods including blood tests, thoracic imaging, or both) and at follow‐up visits at 7‐ to 10‐day intervals after discharge. The last follow‐up visit was scheduled 2 weeks after antimicrobial treatment had concluded. A clinical examination was performed during the follow‐up visits, and blood samples for hematology, APP measurements, and arterial blood gas analysis were obtained and thoracic radiographs were repeated. Owners were contacted 4–8 weeks after the last follow‐up visit to obtain information on possible relapses.
index 3
data Initially, antimicrobial treatment was chosen empirically to cover the most common causative organisms in BP. Later, when bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility results were available, the treatment regimen was re‐evaluated, and if necessary, changes were made according to the culture results. During hospitalization, antimicrobials were administrated IV, and PO treatment was continued after discharge. Dogs were discharged when they did not require oxygen supplementation and were capable of maintaining normal hydration and nutrition PO. At the beginning of the trial, the duration of antimicrobial treatment followed conventional recommendations, and dogs were treated for 3–6 weeks or 1–2 weeks beyond the resolution of alveolar density on the thoracic radiographs.1, 6 Antimicrobial treatment of dogs entering our study during 2012 was discontinued 5–7 days after serum CRP returned to normal (<25 mg/L). Antibiotic treatment was discontinued by the CRP‐guided approach only when owners consented.
index 4
data Hematology, serum biochemistry, arterial blood gas analysis, blood cultures, and fecal analysis along with cytological and microbiological analysis of respiratory samples were performed as previously described.18 Coagulation parameters prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were evaluated with commercial test kits for dogs,a

b. Serum samples obtained for APP analysis either were immediately analyzed or stored at −80° C until analyzed.38, 39, 40 CRP was analyzed by magnetic permeability‐based immunoassayc validated for dogs.41 C‐reactive protein values below the detection limit for the CRP assay (<10 mg/L) were set at 5 mg/L. Results above the upper detection limit for the assay (>210 mg/L) were set at 211 mg/L. A CRP ratio (CRP concentrations at 24 #bib48, and 72 hour divided by the initial concentration), describing the decrease in CRP during early recovery, was calculated after initiation of treatment in dogs with samples available for the time point in question. Samples for SAA analysis were sent on dry ice to an external laboratoryd and measured by an automatede latex agglutination testf validated for dogs.42 Haptoglobin was measured by a commercial colorimetric methodg validated for dogs.43

index 5
data Normality testing was performed by Shapiro–Wilk's test of normality and normal Q–Q plots. The differences between dogs with lsBP and msBP as well as between dogs with Escherichia coli‐induced BP and BP caused by other organisms were evaluated by the independent samples Student's t‐test (normally distributed variables) and Mann–Whitney U‐test (non‐normally distributed variables). The Mann–Whitney U‐test also was used to evaluate whether there were differences in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and transtracheal wash (TTW) fluid differential cell counts and whether the duration of antimicrobial treatment differed in dogs with CRP‐guided and conventional treatment. Initial serum CRP, SAA, Hp, and albumin concentrations were compared among groups of healthy dogs as well as dogs with <2 days and >2 days of hospitalization by the Mann–Whitney U‐test. Bonferroni correction was used in the pairwise comparisons to control for the family‐wise error rate.

data The correlation between serum APPs and clinical variables (body temperature, respiratory rate, partial pressures of arterial oxygen [Pao
2] and carbon dioxide [Paco
2], alveolar–arterial gradient [A‐ao
2], blood leukocyte parameters, and BALF cytology as well as duration of clinical signs and duration of hospitalization) was assessed with Spearman's correlation coefficients. P‐values < .05 were considered statistically significant.
index 7
data The mean curves (Fig 2A–D) were calculated with random‐effects analysis of variance regression models (ANOVA). For CRP and SAA, a logarithmic transformation was computed to normalize the distribution and the fitted values estimated from the models were transformed back to original scale to represent the geometric mean of the response in time. For Hp and Pao
2, the absolute values were used as the response, and the mean curves computed directly from the fitted values. As explanatory variables, the models included the fixed effects of group, day and the 2‐way interaction of group × day, and random effects of dog and dog × day.

data Nineteen dogs diagnosed with BP were included, and 64 privately owned healthy blood donor dogs were chosen as controls for the APP measurements. Age, body weight, and sex distribution of dogs participating in our study are presented in Table 1. The dogs represented various breeds without overrepresentation of any single breed.
index 10
data All dogs were presented as acute emergency cases of varying severity. Fifteen of 19 dogs required hospitalization. One dog died as a consequence of severe BP despite the fact that the bacteria isolated were susceptible to the antibiotics used. One dog was euthanized as a consequence of refractory BP caused by a multiresistant E. coli. None of the owners refused hospitalization or selected euthanasia for financial reasons.
index 11
data Concurrent disease processes possibly predisposing to the development of BP were identified in 6 of 19 dogs (parainfluenza or respiratory corona virus infection [5/6],44 advanced chronic bronchitis [1/6]).
index 12
data Clinical data as well as duration of clinical signs and hospitalization are presented in Table 1. Fecal analyses were available for 15 of 19 dogs, and each sample was negative for lungworms and intestinal parasites. Prothrombin time and aPTT were measured in 8 of 19 dogs on 15 different occasions either at presentation or during hospitalization. Prothrombin time was normal in all measurements. Mildly prolonged aPTT was noted in 3 of 8 dogs. In all 3 dogs, E. coli was detected in respiratory samples. One of these dogs was hospitalized for 5 days; 2 did not survive to hospital discharge.
index 13
data Serum CRP, SAA, and Hp concentrations are presented in Figure 1A–C. In 3 dogs, initial serum CRP concentrations exceeded the upper detection limit for the assay (>210 mg/L) were set at 211 mg/L. Three dogs had received exogenous glucocorticoids (a single PO dose of prednisolone or hydrocortisone [2/3] and daily inhaled fluticasone [1/3]) before inclusion and 1 dog was diagnosed with Cushing's disease after the study period. Serum CRP and SAA (r = 0.60, P = .015), CRP and Hp (r = 0.61, P = .010) as well as SAA and Hp (r = 0.85, P < .001) at presentation were significantly positively correlated. Serum amyloid A concentration was significantly negatively correlated with serum albumin concentration (r = −0.53, P = .035), but CRP (r = −0.22, P = .40) and Hp (r = −0.15, P = .58) were not. Serum APPs at presentation were not significantly correlated with variables of disease severity, such as duration of hospitalization (CRP: r = 0.36, P = .24; SAA: r = 0.462, P = .072; Hp: r = 0.305, P = .235), arterial Pao

data Changes in serum CRP, SAA, Hp, and in arterial Pao

index 15
data The CRP ratio was calculated for hospitalized patients at 24 hours (median, 1.0; interquartile range [IQR], 0.6–2.2; n = 11), 48 hours (median, 0.95; IQR, 0.8–1.1; n = 8), and 72 hours (median, 1.0; IQR, 0.8–1.2; n = 5). C‐reactive protein concentration continued to increase in the first 24 hours in 5 of 11 dogs. The CRP ratios after 24 hours (r = 0.35, P = .30), 48 hours (r = 0.46, P = .25), and 72 hours (r = −0.15, P = .81) were not correlated with the duration of hospitalization.
index 16
data An alveolar lung pattern was detected in 15 of 19 dogs, involving a single lobe in 5 of 15 dogs and multiple lobes in 9 of 15 dogs. A patchy alveolar pattern involving several lobes was found in 1 dog. The cranial (12/15) and middle (7/15) lobes most often were affected. A moderate‐to‐severe interstitial or bronchointerstitial lung pattern was identified in 4 of 19 dogs at presentation. An alveolar pattern in multiple lobes at presentation was detected in 4 of 10 dogs with lsBP and in 6 of 9 dogs with msBP.
index 17
data The alveolar pattern found in 13 of 17 dogs was resolved in a median of 10 days (IQR, 8–15 days), and 9 of 13 dogs had cleared alveolar infiltrates by day 10. At a follow‐up visit 2 weeks after discontinuation of antibiotics, 15 of 17 dogs still had a mild‐to‐moderate bronchial, bronchointerstitial, or interstitial patterns on thoracic radiographs.
index 18
data Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was retrieved in 11 of 19, and TTW was performed in 5 of 19. When BAL or TTW were not available (mainly due to the small size of the patient or the severity of BP), a transthoracic aspirate (TTA) was collected in 2 of 19 and a fresh sputum sample in 1 of 19 dogs. Microbiological analysis was performed in all dogs and the results are presented in Table 1. A cytological analysis was performed in 18 of 19 dogs (cytology was not performed in 1 TTW sample). Results from the cytology analyses are presented in Table 2. Because BALF and TTW fluid cytology did not differ significantly in other cell percentages apart from the percentage of epithelial cells (median in BALF, 0.0; IQR, 0.0–0.0 versus median in TTW fluid, 7.1; IQR, 0.2–16.1; P = .026), combined results are presented for the 2 sampling techniques. Cytology in TTA (n = 2) and fresh sputum (n = 1) samples consisted of markedly increased numbers of neutrophils and intracellular bacteria, and an abundant bacterial growth was detected in these samples. The diagnosis of BP was additionally confirmed by postmortem examination in 1 dog with sputum sampling and in 1 dog with TTA sampling.
index 19
data Dogs with E. coli as a causative agent required significantly (P = .049) longer hospitalization (median, 4.5 days; range, 3.5–5.5) compared to dogs with other causative bacteria (median, 1.0 days; range, 0.5–14.0) and 2 of 4 dogs with E. coli‐induced BP died or were euthanized because of disease severity.
index 20
data Of the 17 dogs surviving to discharge, 9 received antibiotics according to conventional recommendations (median duration of treatment, 35 days; IQR, 29–48 days) and CRP was not used for determining the duration of the treatment. Less severe BP and msBP were observed in 6 of 9 and 3 of 9 of these dogs, respectively. Antimicrobial treatment was discontinued 5–7days after CRP normalization in 8 of 17 dogs (median duration of treatment, 21 days; IQR, 19–29 days). Less severe BP and msBP were observed in 4 of 8 and 4 of 8 of these dogs, respectively. Treatment guided by CRP (median, 21 days) was significantly shorter (P = .015) than conventional treatment (median, 35 days). Sixteen of 17 dogs did not have clinical signs or findings suggestive of BP relapse at follow‐up visits 2 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation or during follow‐up phone calls 4–8 weeks after the follow‐up visit. One dog treated conventionally had a relapse of BP after antibiotic discontinuation, and Cushing's disease was later found as a predisposing factor. Bacteria susceptible to the initially chosen antimicrobials were detected in 15 of 17 dogs. In 2 dogs, bacterial growth was not detected and therefore antimicrobial susceptibility could not be addressed. Of these 2 dogs, 1 was treated according to conventional recommendations and 1 was treated by CRP guidance.
index 21
data All measured positive APPs were significantly increased in dogs with BP at presentation compared to healthy controls. This finding is in agreement with previous reports describing CRP and SAA in dogs with BP.10, 18, 45 Haptoglobin concentrations have not been reported previously, but because significant increases in serum Hp have been reported 24 hours after an inflammatory stimulus, increased concentrations also were expected in BP.9 However, it must be emphasized that APPs are highly nonspecific inflammatory markers and, in addition to BP, increased concentrations may be encountered in a variety of disease processes.8, 9

index 22
data As expected, all positive APPs (CRP, SAA, Hp) correlated positively with each other. However, a negative correlation with albumin did not occur in all comparisons. This is most likely due to the long half‐life of albumin, resulting in a late response not noticeable in acute BP.9

index 23
data Serum APP concentrations at presentation did not differ significantly in dogs with lsBP and msBP. Additionally, serum CRP, SAA, or Hp at presentation did not correlate significantly with markers of disease severity, such as arterial Pao
2 and the duration of hospitalization. Initial serum CRP, SAA, or Hp concentrations in dogs with BP therefore may not be useful indicators of disease severity. A similar observation has been made in studies describing CRP in human patients with CAP.46, 47

index 24
data C‐reactive protein and SAA rapidly decreased after initiation of treatment (Fig 2A,B). These findings indicate that CRP and SAA are useful markers of treatment response. Haptoglobin showed a more gradual increase and decrease and therefore did not reflect clinical recovery as well as CRP and SAA. Because there is a wider range of concentrations and the magnitude of change is more pronounced in SAA compared to CRP, SAA might be a better diagnostic and follow‐up marker than CRP in dogs with BP, as already suggested by a recent study comparing CRP and SAA as diagnostic markers of systemic inflammation.45

index 25
data C‐reactive protein continued to increase within the first 24 hours in 5 dogs. This is not unexpected because dogs with BP were presented acutely and CRP is known to reach peak concentrations approximately 24 hours after the onset of an inflammatory stimulus.48 Consequently, it is not meaningful to interpret the possible CRP decrease as early as 24 hours after initiation of treatment. However, a decrease in serum CRP is expected 48–72 hours after initiation of successful treatment, and a failure to show a decrease has been associated with a poor prognosis in dogs with systemic inflammatory conditions.22, 23, 24 Consecutive measurements of CRP have been to be found useful in humans with CAP, and the magnitude of CRP decrease at days 3 and 4 has been shown to have prognostic value.49, 50, 51 A connection also has been shown between the pattern of serum CRP concentrations and outcome in humans. Patients with persistently high CRP (so‐called nonresponse) or an increase in serum CRP after an initial decrease (so‐called biphasic response) during the first days of hospitalization had a poor prognosis.52 In our study, the CRP ratio, describing the magnitude of decrease after 48 or 72 hours, did not correlate with the duration of hospitalization. This finding could be a consequence of the small number of samples available for CRP measurement at 72 hours: Only 5 dogs with msBP were still alive and hospitalized 72 hours after presentation. Another limitation concerns the method used for CRP measurements. The upper detection limit for the assay used was 210 mg/L, and measurements exceeding this concentration were set at 211 mg/L. Doing so underestimated the increase in serum CRP, because it has been shown that serum CRP can increase markedly above 211 mg/L in dogs with aspiration pneumonia.45 This approach will affect the interpretation of the CRP ratio during the recovery process. These limitations make the interpretation of the CRP ratio in our study less informative. One dog, which was euthanized because of refractory BP, had a biphasic CRP response pattern similar to that described in connection with poor prognosis in humans with CAP.52

index 26
data Regarding other variables, dogs with msBP were characterized by a more pronounced left shift and lymphopenia and were significantly more hypoxemic. Respiratory samples in dogs with msBP were characterized by significantly more pronounced neutrophilia, eosinopenia, and lymphopenia compared to dogs with lsBP. These variables therefore could be useful as early markers aiding in the identification of dogs with a more severe course of BP. Escherichia coli as a causative agent additionally was correlated with a more severe course of BP. Moreover, coagulation abnormalities were detected only in dogs with msBP caused by E. coli. These findings likely are due to endotoxin produced by E. coli, affecting hemodynamics, blood clotting, and cellular and humoral immunity.53 A similar finding of increased disease severity has been described in E. coli‐induced CAP.54 Additionally, prolonged aPTT has been correlated with a worse prognosis in both humans and dogs with systemic inflammation or sepsis.55, 56

index 27
data Initial radiographic findings were consistent with previously reported findings in dogs with BP.2, 3 The resolution of the alveolar lung pattern was followed during hospitalization and follow‐up visits. However, because thoracic radiographs were not repeated daily, an exact time point for the resolution could not be determined. Alveolar infiltrates resolved relatively rapidly in our study (69% of dogs had cleared alveolar infiltrates by day 10) compared to studies of humans. Only 33% of human patients with CAP had clearance of radiographic infiltrates at day 7 and 62% at day 28, and it also has been shown that radiographic normalization lags behind clinical cure as assessed by physicians.57, 58 With CAP, current research has not been able to show benefits for routinely repeating thoracic radiographs after clinical recovery.57, 58, 59 Repeating thoracic radiographs during and after hospitalization therefore is not recommended in patients with uncomplicated recovery.27 Additional information gained by thoracic radiographs, especially after the clearance of alveolar infiltrates, was minimal in our study in dogs with otherwise satisfactory clinical recovery.
index 28
data Antimicrobial treatment currently is recommended for 3–6 weeks or 1–2 weeks beyond the resolution of radiographic changes.1, 6, 7 Markedly shorter antimicrobial courses are used in CAP. Antibiotics are recommended for 7–10 days in cases of mild‐to‐moderate CAP, and the use of biomarkers has proved useful in determining optimal treatment duration.27, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 60 No published clinical studies exist addressing the optimal duration of antimicrobials in dogs with BP, and current recommendations may overestimate the treatment duration needed, especially in uncomplicated cases. Considering the variety of infectious agents and the individual differences in the interactions between microbe and the host immune system, a need also exists in dogs with BP for customizing antibiotic treatment duration according to disease severity and response rate. In our study, normalization of CRP was used to guide duration of antimicrobial treatment in 8 of 17 dogs and resulted in significantly decreased treatment duration compared to 9 of 17 conventionally treated dogs. It would have been ideal to randomize the chosen treatment regimen and stratify the randomization according to disease severity. Instead, conventional treatment was used at the beginning of the study, because previous information on the applicability of CRP to predict treatment duration was lacking. When clinical experience was gained and serum CRP was found to reflect the recovery process well, it was considered safe to stop administering antibiotics after CRP normalization. Ending antimicrobials at the point of CRP normalization was still considered premature and, to increase safety, antimicrobials were administered for 5–7 days after CRP normalization. Relapses of BP were not noted in dogs receiving a CRP‐guided course of antibiotics, and therefore, the approach appears to be safe. However, because the incidence of relapse was low in both groups, our study was not able to identify an optimal end point for antimicrobial treatment and even shorter courses than those used in the CRP‐guided group may have been sufficient in dogs with BP. Additionally, the small number of dogs and lack of randomization are limitations, and larger randomized studies are warranted.
index 29
data In conclusion, dogs with BP had significantly increased serum CRP, SAA, and Hp at presentation, and CRP and SAA decreased rapidly after initiation of treatment and reflected the recovery process well. When CRP normalization was used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment, treatment duration was significantly decreased without increasing the number of relapses.

data Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family that was first identified in Uganda in 1947. The virus has recently attracted global attention due to its rapid spread from Brazil to other countries in the Americas (Dick et al., 1952, Zanluca et al., 2015). The ZIKV outbreak in Brazil has been associated with a significant rise in the number of babies born with microcephaly (Zanluca et al., 2015) and neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and has been declared a “Global Emergency” by the World Health Organization (WHO 2016 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/zika/en/; WHO 2016 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2016/1st-emergency-committee-zika/en/; CDC 2016 http://www.cdc.gov/zika/). Concern over the spread of ZIKV to the Northern Hemisphere with its concomitant morbidity is spurring the search for an effective vaccine. ZIKV is related to dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses (WNV), all of which are arthropod-borne flaviviruses. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV contains a positive, single-stranded, genomic RNA encoding a polyprotein that is proteolytically processed to yield three structural proteins: the capsid (C), the precursor of membrane (prM), and the envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5) (Dick et al., 1952).

data The succesful development of flavivirus vaccines began 80 years ago in 1937 with the yellow fever YFV17D live-attenuated vaccine (Monath, 2008). Since then, > 600 million people have been vaccinated, with 98% protection and a > 10 year persistence of vaccine–induced immunity (Barrett and Teuwen, 2009). However, several severe adverse events associated with vaccine administration have been observed over the last 20 years. Thus, a purified, inactivated vaccine has been recently developed and its testing results suggest good immunogenicity and tolerability (Monath et al., 2011). A few weeks ago, two studies showing immunogenicity of a plasmid DNA or adenovirus (serotype 52) expressing virus-like particles in mice and non-human primates were published (Larocca et al., 2016, Abbink et al., 2016). Here, to build on these initial findings to develop an effective ZIKV vaccine, we describe the development of a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing codon-optimized ZIKV E antigen and a subunit recombinant ZIKV E vaccine delivered transcutaneously by carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) microneedle arrays (MNAs) (Bediz et al., 2014, Korkmaz et al., 2015), investigate their ability to induce neutralizing immune responses, and assess their ability to passively protect against ZIKV challenge in a novel neonatal ZIKV infection mouse model.

data For construction of pAd/ZIKV-Efl, the gene encoding human secretory signal peptide hidden Markov model (SP-HMM, MWWRLWWLLLLLLLLWPMVWA), the extracellular portion of the ZIKV strain BeH815744 envelope gene (GenBank KU365780, defined as amino acids 216–794 of the polyprotein), BamH I-linked T4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain (GSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL), Tobacco Etch Virus Protease (Tp) (ENLYFEG), and six histidine tag were codon-optimized for optimal expression in mammalian cells using the UpGene codon optimization algorithm (Gao et al., 2004). pAd/ZIKV-Efl was generated by subcloning the codon-optimized ZIKV-Efl gene into the shuttle vector, pAd (GenBank U62024) at SalI/NotI sites. Subsequently, replication-defective adenovirus 5, designated as Ad5.ZIKV-Efl, was generated by loxP homologous recombination. Moreover, we also purified recombinant proteins named ZIKV-rEfl from the supernatant using His60 Ni Superflow Resin (Clontech) under native conditions to be used as a subunit vaccine. Briefly, the supernatant of Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells infected with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 30 min and mixed with the same volume of binding buffer (40 mM imidazole, 900 mM NaCl, 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). His60 Ni Superflow Resin (Clontech) previously equilibrated with equilibration buffer (20 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) was added and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The next day, the settled resin mix was packed into an empty column. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer three times followed by 10 ml of wash buffer (40 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) three times and eluted in 10 ml of elution buffer (500 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). The eluate was concentrated and desalted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in an Amicon Ultra-15 filter (Millipore). This desalting step was repeated three times. The concentrations of the purified recombinant ZIKV-Efl were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a protein standard.

data ZIKV stocks were provided by Dr. Rober Tesh of University of Texas Medical Branch. Vero cells were infected with ZIKV DAKAR41542 at MOI of 0.01 and incubated until the monolayer showed significant cytopathic effect. Culture supernantant was clarified by centrifugation at 3000g for 15 min. Virus was precipitated overnight by addition of NaCl (0.4 M) and 6% polyethylene glycol. After centrifugation at 10,000g for 30 min, the viral pellet was re-dissolved to 1/100 of the original volume in PBS and centrifuged on a 5 to 50% sucrose gradient at 90,000g for 3 h, followed by dialysis with PBS buffer. The virus was diluted to a proper concentration with 5% Trehalose Buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 75 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5% Trehalose, 0.0025% Tween 80) and kept at − 80 °C. For the virus titer, vero cells were seeded in a six-well plate at 1 × 105 cells per well. The next day, cells were infected with log dilutions of ZIKV for 1 h and overlayed with 1% methyl cellulose media containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After three days of infection, cells were stained with 1% crystal violet. Plaques were counted and titers were calculated by multiplying the number of plaques by the dilution and dividing by the infection volume.
index 3
data Six- to eight-week-old C57BL/6 female mice (five animals per group) were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) with 1 × 1011 viral particles (v.p.) of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl or PBS as a negative control, and intradermally (i.d.) with MNA coated with 20 μg of ZIKV-rEfl. Two weeks after the primary immunization, mice were boosted intranasally (i.n.) or i.d. with the same dose of the respective immunogens. Mice were bled from the retro-orbital sinus at week 0, 2, 4, and 6, and serum samples were evaluated for ZIKV antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT). For the immunization study, a protocol approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee was followed.
index 4
data To evaluate passive protection by maternal antibody, pups were obtained by mating non-immunized males with immunized females at three weeks following booster vaccination. Pups were challenged intraperitoneally (i.p.) with ZIKV DAKAR41542 (105 pfu/50 μl) at seven days after birth. Two non-challenged pups from each litter were used as a control and bled at 28 days after birth to determine passive maternal antibodies. The physical condition of the pups was observed and their body weights were measured daily for 15 days. Exhibiting > 10% loss of body weight was defined as onset of disease. In addition to mice that were found dead, mice with weight loss exceeding 25% of their highest body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. Severity of neurological signs was scored as described previously (Yoshii et al., 2014). Signs of paralysis and loss of balance associated with viral infection were scored as 0 (absent), 1 (present), or 2 (severe). Scoring for paralysis was assigned as follows: 0, normal; 1, dragging limbs or inversion of dorsum pedis; and 2, complete paralysis and no spontaneous movement. Scoring for loss of balance was assigned as follows: 0, normal; 1, leaning of head or trunk posture to one side; and 2, inability to retain posture and falling to one side or a circling movement to one side. Total scores were quantified and were expressed as means ± the standard errors of the mean.
index 5
data Sera from the animals were collected every two weeks and tested for ZIKV-specific IgG by conventional ELISA. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with 2 × 105 pfu of heat-inactivated ZIKV DAKAR4542 at 60 °C for 20 min per well overnight at 4 °C in carbonate coating buffer (100 mM, pH 9.5) and then blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 2% BSA for 1 h. Mouse sera were diluted 1:200 or 1:20 for pups sera in PBS-T with 1% BSA and incubated for 2 h. After the plates were washed, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Santacruz) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed three times and developed with 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, and the reaction was stopped with 1 M H2SO4 and absorbance at 450 nm was determined using an ELISA reader (BIO-TEK instruments).
index 6
data To determine the plaque reduction neutralizing titer at week 6, 60 μl of the pooled sera or 30 μl of each mouse sera was diluted in twofold serial dilutions (from 1/16 to 1/516 or from 1/32 to 1/1024) and incubated with 100 pfu of ZIKV DAKAR41542 in 100 μl of serum-free media at 37 °C for 1 h and subsequently added to a Vero cell monolayer at a density of 5 × 104 cells grown in six-well tissue culture plates and further incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the inoculant was removed, the semisolid media was added, and the plates were incubated for an additional five days. Titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution still giving a 50% reduction in plaque number (PRNT50) relative to samples incubated with pre-immunized control pooled sera.

data In vitro experiments in this paper were repeated at least twice and data shown are means of those replicates ± standard error. For the statistical analysis, the Student's t-test, one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison tests, and log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test were performed using Graph Pad Prism version 5.0 software (San Diego, California, USA). Results were considered statistically significant when the P value was < 0.05. Symbols *, **, and *** are used to indicate P values of < 0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.001, respectively.

data We generated recombinant E1/E3-deleted adenovirus serotype 5-based vectors that encode for the human secretory signal peptide hidden Markov model (SP-HMM) followed by the codon-optimized extracellular portion of the ZIKV BeH815744 E gene fused to the T4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain (ZIKV-Efl). Moreover, the ZIKV-Efl antigen was engineered with a polyhistidine-tag and a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage sequence to facilitate downstream purification (Fig. 1). The replication-defective adenovirus 5, designated as Ad5.ZIKV-Efl, was generated by loxP homologous recombination as previously described (Kim et al., 2014, Hardy et al., 1997). Recombinant ZIKV-rEfl protein was purified from the supernatant of a Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-infected HEK 293 cell line using His60 Ni Superflow Resin under native conditions and packaged as a subunit vaccine in an MNA (MNA-ZIKV-Efl).
index 9
data We then tested the ability of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl to elicit a specific anti-ZIKV immune response in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated s.c. with 1011vp of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl or i.d. with 20 μg of MNA-ZIKV-rEfl, or with PBS on day 0 followed by booster immunization on day 14 with the same dose i.n. or i.d., respectively (Fig. 2a). At 0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks post prime immunization, sera were obtained from all mice and screened for the presence of ZIKV-specific antibodies using ELISA analysis. ZIKV-specific antibodies were detected as soon as two weeks after the first immunization in the sera of mice vaccinated with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl (P = 0.0002), while mice immunized MNA-ZIKV-rEfl showed significant titers at four weeks after the booster immunization (P < 0.05) when compared with the sera of mice immunized with PBS (Fig. 2b).

data Furthermore, qualitative neutralizing activity of ZIKV antibodies was tested in a PRNT 50% assay. The presence of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies was shown in both Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl, although the response in the mice immunized with MNA-ZIKV-rEfl was four- to 16-fold lower than the response achieved in the mice immunized with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl. As expected, no neutralizing antibody responses were observed in the control animal group (Fig. 2c). These findings support our premise that Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-based ZIKV E antigen vaccines are able to induce neutralizing ZIKV-specific immunity.
index 11
data To further understand how the vaccine induced ZIKV E-specific immunity, neutralizing the ZIKV in vivo and protecting the animal from its pathogenic effects, we developed a passive protection suckling mouse model. Building upon the knowledge (Dick et al., 1952) that day 7- (but not day 14-) old suckling mice are susceptible to ZIKV infection via the i.p. route showing neurological signs, pups were obtained by mating immunized female with nonimmunized male mice at week 3 after booster immunization. Pups were challenged i.p. at seven days after birth with 105 pfu of ZIKV DAKAR41542, monitored daily for mortality, and weighed for 15 days. The mean time to disease onset (10% weight loss) was slightly earlier in the pups from PBS-immunized mice than in those from MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immunized mice, although the difference was not significant (7.75 vs. 8.25 days, P = 0.1598) (Table 1). All pups born to PBS-immunized mice showed more than a 20% body weight loss in the 10 days postinfection. However, weight loss in the MNA-ZIKV-rEfl pups was reduced and a significant difference was found from day 12 (P < 0.01; P < 0.001, day 13–day 15) after challenge when compared to the PBS pups. No weight loss was observed in the pups born to the dams immunized with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl vaccine and no significant difference was measured between the pups of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-immunized mice and the unchallenged control pups for the entire period. The significant difference started at day 8 (P < 0.01; P < 0.001, day 9–day 15) after challenge when compared to the PBS pups. (Fig. 3a). The survival rates of pups from two animals in each group were also monitored after challenge with ZIKV DAKAR41542. Survival rates of 100% (10/10) and 50% (3/6) were observed in the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immunized dams, respectively, whereas a 12.5% (1/8) survival rate was seen in pups from PBS-immunized dams (Fig. 3b). The differences between the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and those from PBS-immunized dams and between the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and those from MNA-ZIKV-immunized dams were statistically significant (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0136, respectively). When the pups from MNA-ZIKV-rEfl- and PBS-immunized dams were compared, no significant difference in survival rate was observed (P = 0.1493), indicating that the Ad5.ZIKV-Efl vaccine candidates were efficient in passively protecting neonatal mice against lethal ZIKV challenge.
index 12
data As expected, all pups of PBS-immunized dams showed neurological signs including loss of balance, paresis, and hindlimb paralysis, with 4.62 ± 1.30 of neurological score. However, five out of six pups of MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immunized dams exhibited neurological illness (no significant difference from the percentage of PBS group; P = 0.2482), although the neurological severity score was significantly lower than that of pups from PBS-immunized mice (P < 0.05). In contrast, the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-immunized mice showed mild symptoms at one time point or no signs of neurological illness (Table 1).
index 13
data Lastly, to detemine the relationship between survival rate and maternally-transferred antibody, the sera from 25-day-old non-challenged pups born from immunized dams were collected and tested for reactivity with ZIKV by ELISA. The level of maternal IgG ZIKV-specific antibodies measured in pups nursed by Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-immunized dams was significantly higher than that in pups nursed by PBS-immunized dams (P < 0.001). However, in the pups nursed by MNA-ZIKV-Efl-immunized dams, the level of IgG antibodies against ZIKV-rEfl was not significantly higher when compared with that in pups nursed by PBS-immunized dams (Fig. S1). These data suggest that the survival rate in pups correlated with the maternally-transferred antibody IgG titer, and although some of the animals immunized with MNA-ZIKV-Efl were protected, the level of ZIKV-specific IgG transferred to the newborns was suboptimal.
index 14
data In this study, we describe the construction and immunological evaluation of two ZIKV vaccine candidates. Our initial evaluations indicated that the ZIKV vaccines Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl elicited a humoral immune response in immunized C57BL/6 mice. The humoral response was characterized by high titers of antibodies to E antigen as confirmed by ELISA, as well as neutralizing titers confirmed by PRNT50 assay. Importantly, in pups born to immunized dams, ZIKV-specific immunity was passively transferred and protected them from day 7 challenge of 105 pfu of the ZIKV DAKAR41542 strain.
index 15
data The Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl vaccines were engineered using the 2015 Brazil ZIKV strain BeH815744. The BeH815744 strain E protein differs from the DAKAR41542 strain E protein used for challenge in three amino acids (98% identity). In general, the ZIKV envelope protein is highly conserved.
index 16
data Although in the presented studies the adenovirus-based Ad5.ZIKV-Efl vaccine was the most potent of the two tested ZIKV vaccine candidates, we acknowledge that is the least likely among the two candidates to be translated into a clinical product. This is because the prevalence of anti-adenovirus serotype 5-neutralizing antibodies in humans limits its use as suitable clinical vaccine platform. However, the experimental use of serotype 5 adenoviral-based vaccines, as shown in this study, is an invaluable tool for the antigen vaccine selection for any given pathogen. Conversely, the MNA-delivered ZIKV vaccine MNA-ZIKV-rEfl, although not optimized for inducing neutralizing immunity in the current format, is a clinically applicable vaccine platform to target infectious diseases such as ZIKV. The geometric design of the MNA-based vaccine platform affords unique advantages for efficient delivery and targeting to the superficial skin microenvironment, which is rich in antigen-presenting cells. While immunogenicity was lower than that observed in a previously reported adjuvented and inactivated whole virus vaccine (Larocca et al., 2016), the MNA-based vaccine offers the safety and clinical advantages of a defined recombinant subunit antigen and the potential for local co-delivery of adjuvants at very low doses. Co-delivery of TLR ligand adjuvants at very low concentrations can substantially increase the immunogenicity of an influenza subunit vaccine (Weldon et al., 2012). Importantly, the fabrication process of MNAs affords unique product advantages in reproducibility, safety, manufacturing, and distribution critical for widespread clinical deployment. Thus, our current and future efforts toward the clinical translation of ZIKV vaccine are directed toward the testing and comparison of different E antigen formats (dimeric vs. trimeric), and clinically relevant antigen-adjuvant formats that can be co-delivered in MNAs.
index 17
data One thing that we learned in the presented ZIKV vaccine studies is that the yield of production of the ZIKV envelope E subunit protein was very low in the current format. This finding, also confirmed by a recently published ZIKV vaccine study (Larocca et al., 2016), is similar to what was previously observed for other flaviviruses (Taylor et al., 2016). The low yield of E protein is probably due to the absence of preM, which is important for protein stability. For instance, expression of WNV E protein alone showed proteolytic cleavage compared to the E protein produced in the presence of preM (Taylor et al., 2016). Thus, the inclusion of preM sequence seems to be an important prerequisite in ZIKV E-based vaccine development. Importantly, in this study, we used an immunocompetent mouse challenge model of ZIKV infection. This approach was inspired by a 1952 publication (Dick et al., 1952) in which ZIKV was shown to be pathogenic in newborn mice. Although this model does not recapitulate the ZIKV pathogenesis observed in humans, it is an effective model to evaluate the in vivo neutralizing activity of vaccine-induced ZIKV immunity. During the conduct of these experiments, many mouse models of ZIKV infection were established in interferon receptor-deficient mice and SJL mice (Cugola et al., 2016, Shah and Kumar, 2016, Miner et al., 2016, Dowall et al., 2016, Lazear et al., 2016, Rossi et al., 2016). Further investigations in SJL mice, the closest clinical model of fetal microcephaly, will be considered to evaluate the efficiency of vaccine candidates here in the future.

data Annually, more than 50000 individuals receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (SCTs) worldwide. SCT recipients are at higher risk of severe infections, since they often remain in a state of immunosuppression after transplantation, depending on such comorbidities as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the need for immunosuppressive drug treatment.12 In particular, SCT recipients are susceptible to common respiratory viruses (CRVs) owing to their impaired T-cell immunity.3 CRVs are common causes of both upper respiratory tract disease (URD) and lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) in this population, and have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality.456 To date, there has been only a preliminary study of infections caused by CRVs among SCT recipients in Korea.78 However, the epidemiology of individual CRVs varies according to the region and the times and many advances in the diagnosis and treatment of infections caused by CRVs have been achieved. The present study aimed to describe the incidence, clinical courses, and risk factors for mortality associated with LRDs caused by CRVs in SCT recipients at a single SCT center in Korea.
index 0
data We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1038 patients aged ≥18 years who had undergone a SCT between January 1, 2007 and August 31, 2011 at the Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Centre of Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea (Seoul, Republic of Korea). The aim was to identify LRDs caused by CRVs. CRVs associated with LRDs in patients included influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) 1–3, human rhinovirus (HRhV), human adenovirus (HAdV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Clinical information, including demographics, comorbidities, coinfections, and mortality were investigated. The endpoint of the study was set as January 31, 2012, or the time of death or loss to follow up. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Yeouido and Seoul St. Mary's Hospital (approval nos. SC10RISI0023 and KC13RISI0364).
index 1
data SCT recipients with respiratory symptoms were screened for CRVs at the discretion of physicians. Specimens for diagnostic testing included nasal or throat swabs, sputum, tracheal aspirates, bronchial wash fluid, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Laboratory tests to identify CRVs included the respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex panel (AdvanSure RV Real-Time PCR Kit; LG Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea) and rapid influenza antigen testing (BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B; BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD, USA). The respiratory virus PCR multiplex panel was used to test for influenza A and B viruses, RSV, HMPV, HPIV, HRhV, and HAdV. Influenza-specific reverse transcription PCR was used to detect the influenza A (H1N1) during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
index 2
data URD was defined as the detection of a CRV in upper respiratory secretions, such as nasal or throat swabs, in association with respiratory symptoms, including cough, rhinorrhea, and sore throat, and in the absence of new infiltrates on chest imaging.910 A LRD was defined as an acute respiratory illness with dyspnea, hypoxia, or pulmonary infiltrates occurring in association with the detection of a CRV in any respiratory secretions.10 Assessment of the radiographic findings, including chest radiography and computed tomography scans, was based on the formal reading by a radiology specialist. Hospital-acquired infection was defined as symptom onset 3 or more days after hospital admission.9 The presence of co-pathogens was defined as the isolation of pathogenic bacterial species, fungal species, or other opportunistic viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), from the respiratory specimen obtained within a month of detection of a CRV, in conjunction with consistent symptoms, and as confirmed by infectious disease specialists.5 Proven or probable invasive fungal disease was defined according to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group Consensus Group in 2008.11 A mixed CRV infection was defined by the isolation of more than two CRVs during the same episode. Mortality due to LRDs caused by CRVs was defined as death resulting from respiratory failure, with no period of complete recovery between the onset of illness and death within 30 days, and without a documented co-pathogen.12 Overall mortality was defined as death from any cause within 30 days following diagnosis of CRV-LRD. An absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of <200 cells/mm3 blood within the 2 weeks preceding a CRV infection diagnosis was defined as lymphopenia, and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <500 cells/mm3 blood within the 2 weeks prior to a CRV infection was defined as neutropenia.6 The dosage of corticosteroid use was classified into three groups according to the highest daily dose taken by the patient during the 2 weeks preceding a CRV infection: high-dose corticosteroid use was defined as ≥1 mg/kg/day of prednisone and its equivalent dose of corticosteroids: low-dose use was defined as ≤1 mg/kg/day of prednisone; and the third group received topical corticosteroids.13 The grade of immunodeficiency was classified into three groups, including severe, moderate, and mild immunodeficiency.14 Severe immunodeficiency (SID) was defined as the presence of two or more of the following: allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) within 6 months, or autologous SCT (autoSCT) within 3 months, preceding the diagnosis of a CRV infection; acute GVHD (grade ≥2); ALC <200 cells/mm3 or ANC <500 cells/mm3 within 2 weeks, before the diagnosis; and a pre-engraftment period or administration of immunosuppressive therapy ≤2 weeks prior to the diagnosis. Moderate immunodeficiency (MID) was defined as the presence of only one criteria of SID or two or more of the following criteria: an alloSCT within 1 year (≥6 months) or an autoSCT within 6 months (≥3 months), prior to the diagnosis of a CRV infection; ALC between 200 and 500 cells/mm3, or ANC between 500 and 1000 cells/mm3, within 2 weeks before the diagnosis; and administration of immunosuppressive drugs within 1 month prior to the diagnosis. Patients who met only one criterion of MID were regarded as having a mild immunodeficiency state.
index 3
data All analyses were performed for the first episode of CRV infection after SCT. Categorical variables are described as number (percentage). Continuous variables are expressed as medians (interquartile range) or mean±standard deviation. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, and continuous variables were compared using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Using Cox proportional hazards regression models, all variables with a p<0.05 upon univariate analysis were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the significance of the risk factors for mortality associated with CRV-LRDs. All p values were two-tailed, and statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
index 4
data A total of 1038 patients received SCTs (273 autologous and 765 allogeneic) between January 1, 2007 and August 31, 2011. Over a 5-year period between 2007 and 2012, 71 CRV-LRDs were identified in 67 (6.5%) patients, and coinfection with more than two CRVs was observed in 4 (5.9%) patients. Influenza A virus and RSV coinfection was observed in two patients. HPIV and HRhV coinfection was observed in one patient, and HPIV and RSV coinfection was also observed in one patient. The baseline characteristics of the 67 SCT recipients with CRV-LRDs are shown in Table 1. During the winter, RSV and influenza A virus were the predominant CRVs, while the proportion of HPIV infection increased through spring and summer (Fig. 1). Analysis for cumulative incidences of first CRV-LRD episodes demonstrated that the most common causative pathogen of CRV-LRDs at both 100 days [cumulative incidence estimate, 23.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.3–43.7] and at 1 year after SCT (cumulative incidence estimate, 69.2%; 95% CI, 45.9–92.5) was HPIV. The cumulative incidence estimate of RSV was 6.9% (95% CI, 0.0–16.1), and only two patients presented with LRDs cau-sed by influenza A virus and HRhV (one patient each) before 100 days following SCT (Fig. 2A). The cumulative incidence estimates of LRDs caused by influenza virus, RSV, HPIV, and HRhV at 1 year after SCT were 42.9% (95% CI, 17.0–68.8), 21.6% (95% CI, 6.3–36.9), 69.2% (95% CI, 45.9–92.5), and 28.6% (95% CI, 0.0–62.1), respectively (Fig. 2B).
index 5
data The characteristics of the LRDs caused by the various CRVs are described in Table 2. The most common type and extent of radiographic infiltration of influenza-caused LRDs were alveolar pattern (64.3%) and bilateral lung field (85.7%), respectively. Seven (50%) of 14 patients with influenza-LRDs received antiviral therapy, and all received it within 48 hours following influenza-LRD diagnosis. However, early antiviral therapy within 48 hours after symptom onset was performed for only 3 (21.4%) patients. One patient received combination therapy with peramivir (600 mg/day for 8 days) and oseltamivir (300 mg/day for 15 days). Five (35.7%) patients experienced mechanical ventilation, and the 30-day overall mortality rate of these patients was 35.7% (5/14). Two patients were diagnosed with the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, of which one died due to respiratory failure on day 28 following the diagnosis. Of the 31 patients with RSV-LRDs, 41.9% (13/31) were hospital-acquired and 9.7% (3/31) received antiviral therapy. The 30-day overall mortality rate was 25.8% (8/31) for these patients. Two patients with RSV-LRDs were treated with oral ribavirin, one with aerosolized ribavirin, and all received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 1–1.5 g/kg for 1–2 days). The patient who received aerosolized ribavirin and IVIG survived, whereas the two patients treated with oral ribavirin died. Seven (36.8%) of the 19 patients with HPIV-LRDs received oral ribavirin (800 mg/day for 11–26 days). The 30-day overall mortality rate of patients with HPIV-LRDs was 31.6% (6/19). Four (57.1%) of seven patients with HRhV-LRDs required mechanical ventilation, and the 30-day mortality rate for these patients was 14.3% (1/7). Co-pathogens isolated from respiratory specimens were detected in 33.8% (23/67) of patients with CRV-LRDs. The most common bacterial co-pathogen was Acinetobacter baumannii (n=7; 10.4%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=5; 7.4%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=4; 5.9%). Aspergillus species were detected in 6 patients and CMV-PCR of the BAL fluid was positive for two patients. Only 2 patients died without pneumonia being the cause of death, one due to septic shock as a result of infectious colitis and one due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
index 6
data The overall mortality at day 30 after the diagnosis of a CRV-LRD was 32.8% (22/67). In the univariate analysis, high-dose steroid usage (p=0.025), SID (p=0.033), and lymphopenia (p=0.006) were significantly associated with mortality within 30 days following a CRV-LRD diagnosis (Table 3). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the use of high-dose steroids [odds ratio (OR), 4.05; 95% CI, 1.12–14.61; p=0.033] and lymphopenia (OR, 6.57; 95% CI, 1.80–24.03; p=0.004) were independent risk factors for mortality within 30 days of CRV-LRD detection (Table 4).
index 7
data There has been almost no data on respiratory virus infection among SCT recipients in Korea. This study aimed to retrospectively collect and analyze data regarding the epidemiology and risk factors of LRDs caused by CRVs in SCT recipients from the largest SCT center in Korea.
index 8
data The incidences of influenza-associated LRD among SCT recipients reported in other studies ranged from 0.4–4.1%, and the mortality rates were 14.7–28%.561015 In previous studies, the proportions of progression to pneumonia among influenza virus-infected SCT recipients were reported as 29–43%.1516 The 30-day mortality rate of influenza-LRD at our center was 14.3%, which is consistent with the previous reports.
index 9
data RSV infections have been reported to occur in 1.2–9.6% of adult SCT recipients.51718 The incidences and mortality rates of RSV-LRDs among SCT recipients were reported as 2.9–5.1% and 16.7–50%, respectively.561417 These findings are consistent with the incidence (2.7%) and mortality rate (22.5%) of RSV-LRD observed at our center, in spite of the low rate of ribavirin treatment (9.7%). Known risk factors of RSV-associated mortality in SCT patients included pre-engraftment, lymphopenia, alloSCT <1 month previously, SID, and an older age (>65 years).1419 The highest incidence of RSV occurred between January and April, which is consistent with our result that the majority of RSV-LRDs were detected between December and March.20
index 10
data Symptomatic HPIV infections have been reported to occur in 1.4–7.1% of adult SCT recipients in previous studies.52122 The reported frequency and mortality rates of HPIV-LRDs among SCT recipients were 0.05–8.1% and 11.8–46%, respectively.56910222324 The 30-day mortality rate of HPIV-LRD at our center, 26.3% (5/19), was similar to that of previous studies, despite the low rate of antiviral treatment (36.8%). Since HPIV showed the highest cumulative incidence of LRDs at 100 days (23.5%; 95% CI, 3.3–43.7) and 1 year (69.2%; 95% CI, 45.9–92.5) following SCT, the performance of a laboratory examination is important due to non-specific respiratory symptoms. Independent predictors of HPIV-associated death that have been reported in the literature include steroid usage, cancer status, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, LRD, infection immediately following SCT (<30 days), mismatched donor, the need for mechanical ventilation, and the presence of co-pathogens.92223 Similarly, high-dose steroid usage at the time of diagnosis was one of the independent predictors of death among SCT recipients with CRV-LRDs in the present study. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that HPIV infections were most prevalent in the summer months, followed by spring, which had been reported previously.922
index 11
data Previous studies reported that the incidence of HRhV-LRD among SCT recipients is rare (0–1.4%), and that HRhV-LRDs are associated with low mortality rates.525 In the present study, the incidence of HRhV-LRD was 0.7% (7/1038 patients) and the associated 30-day mortality rate was 14.3% (1/7 patients). These results are consistent with the preceding studies that HRhV may cause severe infections in SCT recipients, with high rates of progression to LRD and mortality.182627 Ison, et al.28 reported that all 6 SCT recipients with pneumonia in whom HRhV was detected in BAL had significant coinfections and suggested that HRhV might be a cause of frequent superinfections, possibly through lytic infection or an indirect immunosuppressive effect. Our study also indicated that 42.9% (3/7) of patients with HRhV-LRDs were positive for the presence of co-pathogens.
index 12
data HAdV has been shown to infect up to 3% of SCT recipients, and the subsequent mortality rate can be high (15–28%).29 HMPV-LRDs have been reported to occur in 0.7–1.2% of SCT recipients, of which 0–40% progressed to death.530 However, no cases of HAdV-LRDs or HMPV-LRDs were observed in our patient cohort.
index 13
data CRV infection may contribute to sustained inflammation or activation of an inflammatory process that leads to irreversible airway damage, and can cause late airflow obstruction in SCT recipients.31 Furthermore, CRV infections frequently coexist with bacterial or fungal pathogens, contributing to the development of pneumonia. It may be the result of epithelial damage, impaired ciliary function, an altered immune response, or up-regulation of bacterial receptors on the CRV-infected respiratory tract.1632 In addition, there have been several reports that SCT recipients have shown a lower immune response to the influenza vaccine compared with that observed for the general population.3334 Severely immunocompromised patients, such as SCT recipients, have been reported to show prolonged influenza shedding, resulting in the development of antiviral resistance during prolonged antiviral therapy.
index 14
data In the present study, high-dose steroid usage and lymphopenia were shown to be risk factors for mortality in SCT recipients with CRV-LRDs. Lymphopenia was previously reported as a risk factor for mortality among SCT patients with LRDs caused by influenza or RSV.61319 Additionally, high-dose steroid usage during the 2 weeks preceding a CRV-LRD diagnosis was reported as an independent predictor of mortality among SCT recipients with HPIV-LRDs.923 It is likely that these two risk factors are associated with a decreased T-cell-mediated immune response.22 Furthermore, high-dose corticosteroid use is known to be associated with a trend toward delayed viral clearance.35 Conversely, a few previous studies reported that the use of corticosteroids exerted protective effects against the progression to pneumonia and requirement for mechanical ventilation among SCT recipients with influenza-LRDs, which was hypothesized to occur due to a salutary immunomodulatory effect.1315
index 15
data There are several limitations of the present study. As this was a retrospective study, there were no standardized guidelines for the screening and treatment of CRV infections. However, to overcome this limitation, only CRV-LRD cases were included. Due to the small number of cases, it was not possible to analyze the risk factors for mortality for individual CRV-LRDs. Another limitation was that it was difficult to determine whether the fatal outcome was solely attributable to the CRV or due to a combination of the CRV and co-pathogens. However, precise discrimination of the pathogen would likely have been meaningless, since damage to the respiratory epithelium as a result of a CRV infection may have been the key factor that facilitated the occurrence of superinfections.9 Recent studies showed that viral nucleic acid was detected in the bloodstream more frequently among SCT recipients with LRDs caused by influenza, RSV, HAdV, and HMPV, and that this was associated with increased mortality rates.363738 Therefore, viral nucleic acid detection in the bloodstream of SCT recipients with CRV-LRDs could be used to predict disease severity, poor outcome, and the need for intensified antiviral treatment in the future.
index 16
data Our study demonstrated that CRV-LRDs have a significant morbidity and mortality among SCT recipients; thus, the implement of an active diagnostic approach for CRV infection is required for SCT recipients with respiratory symptoms. For SCT recipients with LRDs caused by influenza, RSV, or HPIV infections, those receiving high-dose steroid treatment or those with lymphopenia, early antiviral treatment should be considered; especially considering the fact that no vaccine is yet available for RSV and HPIV. Furthermore, infection control measures, including hand hygiene and respiratory droplet isolation, which reduce the occurrence of new infections and transmission, are important for CRVs without a specific antiviral treatment option, such as HRhV and HMPV. Finally, in order to prevent LRDs caused by influenza, which is the only CRV with an available vaccine, the annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all SCT recipients.

data Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (1). They are widespread and can be found in many species of mice, horses, whales, birds, cats, dogs, pigs, and humans (1). Development of the infection, can lead to additional complications, including respiratory tract disease and organ dysfunction, particularly renal failure and immune suppression, enteric, neurologic or hepatic diseases (2, 3). The majority of patients have typical symptoms, such as fever with or without cough, and breathing difficulties (4). Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a new and unknown origin respiratory virus with genotypic and phenotypic diversity; thus, this virus can mutate, increasing its virulence and even causing tissue tropism. There is a high-frequency mortality rate around > 50% and median age of the majority of identified cases affected with this virus is 56 years. Very little is known about its behavior (5, 6). Humans are known to maintain circulation of four different human coronaviruses (hCoVs) at a global population level. These are a part of the spectrum of agents that cause the common cold. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV constitutes the fifth hCoV, which was in circulation for a limited time during 2002 and 2003, when a virus appeared in humans and caused an outbreak affecting at least 8,000 people. Symptoms matched the clinical picture of acute primary viral pneumonia. MERS-CoV, a novel coronavirus, was detected for the first time in September of 2012 in Saudi Arabia, an area heavily impacted by this virus at present. Between April and June 2013, 81 cases of infection by this hCoV were reported in Saudi Arabia. Of those, 49 patients died, so fatality rate is high (2). This virus (MERS-CoV) causes severe acute respiratory infection in humans (7). Subsequently MERS-CoV has been reported in other countries, including Tunisia, United Arab, Emirates, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Qatar (2, 8-11). The first cases of MERS-CoV infections reported in Iran were two cases in Kerman, a city in southeast Iran. The virus killed one of them, a 53-year-old woman. With the appearance of new cases, in view of the risk of MERS-CoV transmission to humans (6), and because of severe infections that have been observed among the elderly, there is considerable concern about this virus (5). Although few cases have been reported annually (around 34 case as of 12 May 2013), the morbidity and mortality rate of this infection is alarming (7). Unfortunately, at present, there are no specific treatments or effective drugs for this deadly disease, and no vaccine. In the absence of an effective treatment, the appropriate infection controls include rapid diagnostics and isolation of patients, useful strategies for preventing further transmission and spread of this infectious agent (5). Currently, real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays are used for detection of MERS-CoV in respiratory, blood, and stool samples of patients. Real-time RT-PCR assay is highly sensitive and is able to detect viruses even in low copy numbers (12, 13).
index 0
data Our aims in this research were to present two rRT-PCR assays for in-house rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing of MERS-CoV, detecting the regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1b, respectively, for initial screening and final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection (according to world health organization (WHO) recommendations).
index 1
data In this experimental study, the sequences, obtained from the National center for biotechnology information (NCBI; GenBank accession number: JX869059 for the Rotterdam virus isolate, termed hCoV-EMC), were synthesized (Eurofins Genomics, Germany) and served as templates for assay design. The DNA templates from upE and ORF1b of novel human coronavirus were amplified and confirmed using the corresponding real-time PCR specific probes and primers (forward and reverse) of each signature.
index 2
data Target regions upE and ORF1b, synthesized by Eurofins Genomics (Germany) in the same vector (pGH cloning vector) were subcloned into the pSPT18 (Roche) expression vector using the HindIII restriction site (results not presented) and subsequently were transcribed into RNA for preparation of viral templates using the SP6/T7 Transcription kit (Roche) to synthesize both single-stranded RNAs. At all steps, contamination with RNase must be avoided through the usual diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treatments, the use of disposable plasticware, wearing gloves, etc. After DNase I digestion, both RNA transcripts were purified using Roche High Pure Viral RNA Kit and quantified by ultraviolet (UV) light spectroscopy. No DNA content remained at this stage due to its removal, and results of common real-time PCR assays were negative (results not presented), whereas the results of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays were positive.
index 3
data The novel in-house one-step rRT-PCR assay was developed using the QuantiFast RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on Corbet (Rotor-Gene) 6000 (Qiagen, Germany) real-time PCR instrument. Each 25 µL reaction mixture contained 12.5 µL of 2 × Master Mix, 1 µL of reverse transcriptase/Taq DNA polymerase mixture, 0.4 mM of each dNTP and 3.2 mM magnesium sulfate, 5 μL of RNA, 400 nM concentrations of upE forward primer (GCAACGCGCGATTCAGTT) and upE reverse primer (GCCTCTACACGGGACCCATA), and 200 nM of upE probe (6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM]-CTCTTCACATAATCGCCCCGAGCTCG-6-carboxy-N, N, N, N’-tetramethylrhodamine [TAMRA]). Thermal cycling included 55°C for 20 minutes, followed by 95°C for 3 minutes and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 58°C for 30 seconds. It should be mentioned that common one-step real-time RT-PCR kits formulated for application with probes should all provide satisfactory results with default reaction mix compositions as suggested by their manufacturers.
index 4
data This confirmatory assay had the same conditions as described above for the upE rRT-PCR, albeit the primer and probe sequences were different. This assay was performed with ORF1b forward primer (TTCGATGTTGAGGGTGCTCAT) and reverse primer (TCACACCAGTTGAAAATCCTAATTG), as well as its specific probe (6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM]-CCCGTAATGCATGTGGCACCAATGT-6-carboxy-N, N, N, N’ tetramethylrhodamine [TAMRA]). This target gene did not overlap with those of known pan-CoV assays (2, 6, 7).
index 5
data As noted above, two transcribed candidate signatures (target regions) upE and ORF1b, were used in both assays. Because of the difficulties in acquiring patient samples, according to WHO recommendation, these two RNA sequences were also synthesized (Eurofins Genomics, Germany) and used as RNA controls (standard RNAs) in optimization of the two assays and for preparation of serial dilutions for the evaluation of sensitivity. All RNA dilutions were prepared in RNase-free water.
index 6
data A) Limit of detection - MERS-CoV upE gene: serial dilutions of quantified standard upE RNAs (10, 100, 1000, 10000) were prepared in 10 mM TE buffer and tested by upE assay signature in 25 replicates. The highest dilution of upE RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the upE assay.
index 7
data B) Limit of detection - MERS-CoV ORF1b gene: sensitivity evaluation was optimized by testing candidate probes and primers in the ORF1b signature assay with serial dilutions (5, 50, 500, 5000) of MERS-CoV quantified standard ORF1b RNAs in separate reactions and comparing them. Ten-fold serial dilutions of MERS-CoV ORF1b RNAs were prepared in buffer as above and tested in 25 replicates. The highest dilution of ORF1b RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the ORF1b assay. A volume of 5 µL was used in two real-time RT-PCR assays of upE and ORF1b.
index 8
data Reactivity with different MERS-CoV strains (in silico prediction): In addition to demonstrating reactivity of the rRT-PCR assay with the MERS-CoV strain Jordan-N3/NCV, primer/probe sequences were evaluated against an additional eight recently published genome sequences from seven patients collected from June 2012 to May 2013: GenBank accession numbers JX869059, KC776174, KC164505, KC667074, HPA Website (http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1317138176202), KF192507, KF186564-KF186567. Primer/probe sequences for all signatures were 100% identical to all published virus strains (results not presented).
index 9
data The DNA templates synthesized from upE and ORF1b of novel human coronavirus were amplified and confirmed using 2% gel-based traditional PCR (Figure 1) and common real-time PCR with the corresponding specific probes and primers (forward and reverse) of each signature (Figures 2 and 3).
index 10
data This confirmatory one-step rRT-PCR assay was performed for synthetic standard RNA containing upE signature using specific probe and primers (Figure 4). This test can initially screen for MERS-CoV infection bebecause it is a highly sensitive assay. The results of RNA transcripts (containing upE signature) were confirmatory, and were also similar to those of synthetic standard RNAs (results not presented here).
index 11
data This confirmatory one-step rRT-PCR assay was performed for synthetic standard RNA containing ORF1b signature using specific probe and primers (Figure 5). This test can conclusively detect MERS-CoV infection bebecause it is a highly specific assay. The results of RNA transcripts (containing ORF1b signature) were confirmatory, and were also similar to those of synthetic standard RNAs (results not presented here).
index 12
data We prepared serial dilutions of standard RNAs for evaluation of analytical sensitivity of assays (Figure 6). As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the stages of sensitivity (minimum detection limit) determination for each of these genes were done separately and the real-time RT-PCR assays showed different sensitivities for upE and ORF1b target regions.
index 13
data A) Limit of detection (LoD) of the MERS-CoV upE gene: The serial dilutions containing 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 copies of standard RNAs per reaction were analyzed using the real-time RT-PCR assay. The highest dilution of upE RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the upE assay. The minimum detection limit of the assay signature was fewer than ten copies of standard RNAs per reaction (Table 1), as the higher dilutions were not evaluated.
index 14
data B) Limit of detection (LoD) of the MERS-CoV ORF1b gene: The serial dilutions containing 5, 50, 500, and 5000 copies of standard RNAs per reaction were analyzed using the real-time RT-PCR assay. The highest dilution of ORF1b RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the ORF1b assay. The minimum detection limit of the assay signature was 50 or fewer copies of standard RNAs per reaction (Table 2), as the dilutions between 5 and 50 copies of standard RNAs per reaction were not evaluated.
index 15
data This study showed that both the developed novel one-step rRT-PCR assays based on specific TaqMan probes are rapid, reliable, reproducible, specific, sensitive, and simple molecular methods for detection of MERS-CoV. Finally, the kit consisting of two assay signatures and controls was assembled, and it can be distributed to public health laboratories in Iran to support international MERS-CoV surveillance and public health response.

data As a respiratory research nurse, my day-to-day work involves running both observational studies and clinical trials of investigational products for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Towards the end of 2014, I responded to an advert from the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health at Oxford University, who were looking for research nurses to work on a fast-tracked clinical trials programme in West Africa, made possible by a grant from the Wellcome Trust. As part of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC), the team in Oxford, along with other partners, was to test the effectiveness of promising drugs for the treatment of Ebola virus disease. Based on available data, promising drugs were shortlisted by the World Health Organization (WHO) who facilitated their availability and had taken the decision that in such circumstances it was ethical to fast track the trial of drugs still at a relatively early stage of testing.
index 0
data My response to the advert was a little late and so I was told that a team had already deployed to Liberia just before Christmas to set-up the first trial, which was testing an oral antiviral drug in Monrovia. However, in February 2015 I received a call out of the blue from the Oxford team who informed me that they were setting up another trial of an intravenous antiviral at one of the Ebola management centres (EMCs) in Sierra Leone and asked if I could deploy in a matter of weeks. This was the start of a whirlwind 3-month period that included humanitarian response training; protocol training; a 6-week deployment to Sierra Leone; and finally a 3-week period of semi-isolation and public health monitoring on my return home.
index 1
data Full scale, robust clinical trials of investigational products are not commonly conducted during acute, fast moving infection outbreaks. As anyone who has worked in clinical research will know, finalising the various contracts, agreements and approvals, training and other bureaucracy can take a long time. It is not uncommon for clinical trials to take between 18 months and 2 years to set-up. Previous attempts to carry out research during an outbreak include an attempt to conduct a trial during the 2009 flu pandemic that was hindered by regulatory and legal delays. This meant it was 8 months before the first patient could be recruited. When there are insufficient background cases between epidemics to generate the data required to prove the benefit of any intervention, the outbreak environment may be the only chance we get to carry out trials like this.
index 2
data The aim was to set-up the trials in West Africa as quickly as possible without cutting any corners and in full compliance with Good Clinical Practice. All aspects of trial set-up were conducted simultaneously. Trial design, writing of protocols and the submitting of applications were all started before the WHO had even finalised the particular drugs to be tested. Members of the Oxford team travelled to West Africa to identify particular EMCs that may be suitable to host the trials and to build relationships with the nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) running the centres, the regulatory authorities and those who would become our in-country co-investigators and collaborators. When it came to location, there were many logistical issues to think about including accessibility, the presence of a suitable pharmacy area that would allow us to comply with study drug storage and preparation requirements, suitable lab facilities, internet access and somewhere that was as safe as possible for trial staff to work in terms of infection control procedures and the specific personal protective equipment (PPE) used.
index 3
data The first members of the team I was to join travelled to Sierra Leone in February 2015 to start setting up the trial in a British government built EMC near Port Loko (figure 1). The EMC was run by an Irish NGO called GOAL, who had agreed to partner with the Oxford team and host the trial. By the time I arrived in March, we were given the go ahead to start recruiting. Our office consisted of a tent within the EMC that was furnished with office supplies brought out from Oxford in drips and drabs by various team members. Communication between the team back in Oxford and our clinical leads, who also had responsibility for the whole field team’s welfare, was constant. This presented particular challenges with unreliable internet access, especially during the weekly conference calls and when attempting to share scanned documents. Laptops and other electrical equipment were prone to overheating in our office, which regularly reached stifling temperatures.
index 4
data The overarching factor affecting everything from trial design to our standard operating procedures and everyday trial tasks was, of course, the unique environment of biocontainment that we were working in (figures 2 and 3). The way I work at home had to be completely turned on its head and one thing I found incredibly difficult as a nurse was the reversal in the priority of care. What was emphasised from the very beginning was that protecting my own safety, that of my colleagues and that of the non-infected community was to take priority over patient care.
index 5
data Entering the patient care area, known as the red zone, required well-practiced, methodical donning of PPE in a buddy system (figure 4). Once in, every movement was planned and deliberate so as to prevent any PPE breaches or overheating. Simple tasks such as recording a patient’s temperature on a chart became cognitively challenging due to the extreme heat. Entry times were strictly monitored by other members of the team and could be as short as 40 min in the midday sun. Then, the next pair donned their PPE and arrived to take over the task, whether it was setting up the study drug infusions or carrying out observations. The amount of work that I would achieve by myself in a short time at home suddenly required eight people.
index 6
data Other huge challenges included gaining informed consent to participate, and communicating with and offering comfort to patients while effectively wearing full-face masks and hoods. There were also issues surrounding cultural sensitivity. These would have been impossible to overcome had it not been for our Sierra Leonean colleagues who spoke the local dialects and were absolutely indispensable. Again, as a research nurse one of my most important roles is to make sure that a participant’s best interests are at the heart of what we do and that consent is informed and voluntary. Trying to explain the concept of the trial to someone who is extremely sick, does not speak English, may not have an understanding of research and who also may not believe that Ebola really exists is not an easy task. In a place where traditional healers and village chiefs are held in high regard and there is fear and a lack of trust in Western medicine, rumours run rife and a mob is quick to form if people believe that there is deliberate harm being done within the confines of the EMC. Infection control, contact tracing and social mobilisation were the main pillars of containing the outbreak; however, the role of the purpose built EMCs was important to isolate the thousands of cases, and although the basic care consisted only of symptom relief, rehydration and prevention of secondary infections, it still provided a chance for recovery. The last thing we wanted was for the trial to put people off presenting to the EMC.
index 7
data This completely unexpected outbreak has further weakened the healthcare system and health infrastructure in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, including the tragic loss of so many healthcare professionals to the disease itself. A history of political instability and civil war meant that even before the outbreak the healthcare infrastructure was struggling to meet the basic healthcare needs of the population. I witnessed the knock-on effect of the outbreak on excess mortality and morbidity due to other diseases and vaccination programmes that were stopped in their tracks. The impact of an outbreak like this is far reaching and the international community must assist these countries to build both their basic healthcare systems and their capacity to carry out outbreak surveillance, speedy identification of cases and implement infection control measures.
index 8
data Ideally there will come a time when research to find potential treatments and vaccines for emerging infections can be integrated as part of the overall response to an outbreak, be it pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, one of the viral haemorrhagic fevers or any other novel or re-emerging infection. This would require international teams of clinicians with clinical research experience who could be quickly sourced and deployed to facilitate the timely initiation of clinical trials. The Oxford team is currently considering the possibility of setting up such a register. Of course, this also requires buy-in from employers at home to release staff for periods of deployment. I feel extremely privileged to have to have had the opportunity to play even a small part in creating what we hope will become a blueprint for the set-up and delivery of robust clinical trials during fast moving outbreaks, be it in low resource settings or closer to home.

data Viral diseases can produce the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)[1]. Pandemic viruses are the most common viruses that produce lung injury. Influenza viruses and coronaviruses (e.g., H5N1, H1N1 2009, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus) are potentially lethal pathogens known to produce lung injury and death from ARDS[2-5]. At the tissue level, lung injury results from increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane that leads to hypoxia, pulmonary edema, and intense cellular infiltration, particularly neutrophilic infiltration. The exact pathogenesis of virus-induced ARDS is slowly becoming understood. Unlike the “cytokine storm” occurring in bacterial sepsis that leads to up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g., interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-8, IL-6] and generation of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species in the vascular space, viruses such as the influenza virus target alveolar epithelium, disabling sodium pump activity, damaging tight junctions, and inducing cell death in infected cells. Cytokines produced by virally infected alveolar epithelial cells activate adjacent lung capillary endothelial cells which then leads to neutrophil infiltration. Subsequent production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species by infiltrating neutrophils further damages lung barrier function[1]. Apart from pandemic viruses other viruses, are increasingly reported to produce severe ARDS. While most of the approximately 100 strains of enterovirus primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract, enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) has tropism for the respiratory tract. EV-D68 produces acute respiratory disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe pneumonia and lung injury as in the case we describe here. In an outpatient setting, EV-D68 disease has manifested most commonly among persons younger than 20 years and adults aged 50-59 years[6]. In August 2014, EV-D68 emerged as a cause of severe respiratory infections with hospitals in Illinois and Missouri reporting an increased incidence of rhinovirus and enterovirus infection[7]. In this report, 30 of 36 isolates from the nasopharyngeal secretions of patients with severe respiratory illness were identified as EV-D68. Following these reports, an unusually high number of patients with severe respiratory illness were admitted to these facilities, presumably with EV-D68 infection. Enterovirus-D68 leading to ARDS has been reported in China, Japan, and in the United States[8-11]. The report by Farrell et al[11], describes a previously healthy 26-year-old woman who developed severe ARDS following an enterovirus-D68 infection. Despite all critical care support measures, the patient required protracted mechanical ventilation for 32-d, necessitating tracheostomy and endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. She was discharged alive 55 d following admission. Enterovirus and rhinovirus were recovered from the respiratory secretions of the patient we report here. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was rapidly required in our patient’s care following failure of conventional mechanical ventilation. The patient reported by Farrell et al[11] is the full extent of support required for patients with ARDS who ultimately develop a fibroproliferative course as described by Burnham et al[12]. Karhu et al[13] and Choi et al[14] recently reported finding rhinovirus as the etiology of severe community acquired pneumonia and respiratory failure in mechanically ventilated adults who had a proven viral etiology of respiratory failure.
index 0
data We report here the first application of high dose intravenous vitamin C employed as an interventional drug treatment for virus-induced ARDS. Very few studies in critically ill patients with ARDS have reported the use of intravenous vitamin C. The use of vitamin C to treat lung injury is still investigational. Nathens et al[15] infused ascorbic acid at 1 g every 8 h combined with oral vitamin E for 28 d in 594 surgically critically ill patients and found a significantly lower incidence of acute lung injury and multiple organ failure. Tanaka et al[16] infused ascorbic acid continuously at 66 mg/kg per hour for the first 24 h in patients with greater than 50% surface area burns and showed significantly reduced burn capillary permeability. A single report (published as abstract only) of a clinical study of large intravenous doses of ascorbic acid, and other antioxidants (tocopherol, N-acetyl-cysteine, selenium), in patients with established ARDS showed reduction in mortality of 50%[17]. Clinical protocols currently in use for hospitalized septic patients fail to normalize ascorbic acid levels. Vitamin C dosages utilized in the treatment of the patient we describe in this case report arose from our previous human studies, infusing high dose intravenous vitamin C into critically ill patients with severe sepsis[18] and in our preclinical studies[19-21]. Our work thus far shows vitamin C to exert potent “pleotropic effects” when used as described in this report. We showed that septic patients receiving high dose intravenous vitamin C exhibit significant reduction in multiple organ injury and reduced inflammatory biomarker levels[18]. Our preclinical work in septic lung-injured animals shows that vitamin C down-regulates pro-inflammatory genes that are driven by transcription factor NF-κB. Furthermore, vitamin C significantly increases alveolar fluid clearance in septic lung-injured animals[21]. Finally, infused vitamin C’s capability to down-regulate liberated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species appears to be critical for attenuating lung injury[22].

data A 20-year-old white female presented to urgent care with 24 h of increasing dyspnea after returning from a 7-d trip to Italy. While in Italy she was exposed to several members of the family with whom she was visiting who had symptoms of upper tract respiratory infection. One family member had recently traveled to Morocco. While in Italy, the patient had visited a buffalo farm and ate unpasteurized cheese. There were no other unusual exposures. She noted cough and yellow sputum for 3 d with intermittent fever and night sweats.
index 2
data A chest X-ray revealed diffuse bilateral opacities (Figure 1). Arterial blood gas testing revealed severe hypoxemia while receiving 100% oxygen by non-rebreather mask. Antibiotics were initiated and she was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia. She denied GI symptoms, rash or arthralgia. She denied any history of thromboembolic disease, chest or leg pain or swelling. Her only medication was oral contraceptive for migraines associated with her menstrual cycle. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation failed to support hypoxemic respiratory failure and intubation was required on hospital day 3. An echocardiogram revealed normal cardiac function. Respiratory cultures were negative, but a molecular detection viral respiratory panel was positive for enterovirus/rhinovirus (FilmArray, BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, Salt Lake City, Utah). Despite high PEEP and low tidal volume ventilation, hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 = 75) and hypercapnia remained severe. Chest imaging on hospital day 3 revealed dense bilateral opacities with central air bronchograms (Figure 2). Due to failure of conventional ventilatory strategies, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated on hospital day 3. Low tidal volume assist-control, pressure-control ventilatory strategy was continued. Vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin started at ICU admission were continued. High-dose intravenous vitamin C (200 mg/kg per 24 h) was initiated on ECMO day 1 with the total daily vitamin C dosage divided equally into four doses and infused every 6 h. AP chest X-ray imaging on ECMO day 2 following institution of vitamin C infusion revealed significant improvement in bilateral lung opacities (Figure 3). Given the patient’s hemodynamic instability and vasopressor requirements, the critical care physician staff and nursing staff were very careful to keep the patient’s intake and output fluid balance even, being careful not to volume load a patient who was suffering from permeability pulmonary edema. Bronchoscopy on ECMO day 3 was negative for bacterial or fungal respiratory pathogens. Histoplasma, Blastomyces, Aspergillus, and Legionella antigen studies were negative. Furosemide was used to achieve a daily negative fluid balance. Daily chest imaging with AP chest X-rays documented continued resolution of bilateral opacities. Importantly, lung gas exchange significantly improved following institution of vitamin C infusions. Chest imaging on ECMO day 6 revealed significant further reduction in lung opacities. ECMO decannulation and extubation from ventilation occurred on ECMO day 7 (Figure 4). Vitamin C dosing was continued while the patient remained on ECMO. Vitamin C dosing was reduced by half (100 mg/kg per 24 h) for one day following decannulation from ECMO then reduced by half again (50 mg/kg per 24 h) for an additional day. Post-extubation the patient required 4 L/min nasal oxygen for 48 h and then was discharged home on room air. She was discharged home on hospital day 12. Although we did not quantify the plasma ascorbic acid levels in the patient we report here, we have previously reported that critically ill patients with severe sepsis treated with the identical vitamin C infusion protocol achieved plasma ascorbic acid levels of 3.2 mmol, values which are 60 fold higher than normal plasma ascorbic acid levels[18].
index 3
data In conclusion, we report here the first use of vitamin C as an interventional drug to attenuate lung injury produced by viral infection. The patient described here was discharged home 12 d following hospitalization, requiring no oxygen therapy. Follow-up exam at 1 mo following the patient’s initial hospitalization revealed her to have completely recovered. Figure 5 displays her follow-up chest X-ray film. Importantly, it should be noted that this is a single case report. The role of Vitamin C in this patient’s recovery is not certain, and clearly additional investigation will be required before this can be recommended as a therapy for ARDS.

data A 20-year-old female with no significant medical history presented with acute respiratory failure following a spring break in central Italy. While in Italy she was exposed to a sick contact who was a member of the family she was staying with.
index 6
data The clinical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in this case was established by the extent of respiratory failure present, the radiographic findings, and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support required. The patient’s exposure to the sick contact in Italy suggested the diagnosis of a viral etiology.

data The diagnosis of the etiology of the patient’s respiratory failure was obtained by a panel that uses real-time polymerase chain reaction technology to identify respiratory viral pathogens. FilmArray Respiratory panel is manufactured by BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, Salt Lake City, Utah.
index 9
data Standard Anterior-Posterior chest X-ray films confirmed the diagnosis of ARDS.
index 10
data No lung tissue was obtained from the patient. The diagnosis of ARDS was established by the extent of respiratory failure and the imaging required during the patients hospital stay.
index 11
data In this case report, the authors describe the first use of high dosage intravenous vitamin C as adjunctive therapy for viral induced ARDS.
index 12
data At this point in time, there are no other case reports specifically referencing vitamin C as a treatment for ARDS. The authors have previously reported (ref. [18]) the use of high dose vitamin C as an adjunctive therapy for severe sepsis. Many patients in that trial likely could be considered to have had ARDS.
index 13
data For many years multiple investigators have conducted clinical treatment trials, searching for effective therapies to assist in the treatment for ARDS. In this case report, the authors may have shed new light on a treatment which may ultimately be effective. The successful outcome described in this case report would suggest that larger trials must be conducted with high dosage intravenous vitamin C.
index 14
data This is an interesting report of use of high dose intravenous vitamin C in ARDS.

data Since the efficacy of transferring patients with severe respiratory failure to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) center was first reported, the safe and timely transfer of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has attracted increasing attention [1]. ECMO is being used more frequently as a treatment for severe ARDS, and the need for ECMO in transit has increased [2]. In particular, during the recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea, ECMO interhospital transport played a significant role in patients requiring transfer to an ECMO center for ARDS treatment. However, South Korea still lacks a well-established ECMO interhospital transport system due to limited resources. Recent advances in ECMO have suggested that ECMO can function as an alternative to a ventilator for oxygenation. ECMO without mechanical ventilation has been used in a number of ARDS patients. In view of this, we have greatly simplified our ECMO transport system and have been operating our ECMO interhospital transport program without the use of mechanical ventilation [3]. During the planning stage of our ECMO transport program, our goal was to maximize the utilization of hospital staff and facilities and to develop an ECMO transport system using the public emergency medical services (EMS) systems. Our system was specifically designed to address the medical circumstances in South Korea and can be appropriately applied to other hospitals in South Korea. In this study, we review our experiences using an interhospital ECMO transport program without mechanical ventilation in a resource-limited environment.
index 0
data Target patients were selected from those patients referred from other hospitals based on the determination of a need for ECMO treatment for acute respiratory failure and heart failure. Transport was implemented only after 2 or more intensive care specialists and thoracic surgeons verified the indications for ECMO and ruled out any contraindications to ECMO (Table 1).

data We devised a short-distance transport program for patients in Busan and South Gyeongsang province. Helicopter transport, which was not feasible at night and required takeoff and landing areas, was deemed impractical. Ambulance transport is the primary transportation mode for the emergency medical system in South Korea. The transport range was determined as the area where interhospital transport was feasible within 4 hours, the duration of capacity for the electrical power supply of available ambulances and the loading capacity of O2 tanks. Since our hospital neither owned nor operated an ambulance, we designed our transport system to utilize the 119 existing EMS or private ambulance services (Fig. 1). The transport team consisted of specialists capable of solving mechanical problems pertinent to ECMO, as well as treating episodes of cardiac arrest that can occur during emergency transport. The team included 2 thoracic surgeons, 2 clinical perfusionists with nursing experience, and 1 ambulance driver.
index 2
data The equipment system used during transport consisted of the ECMO machine and circuit, cannulas in a variety of sizes, a bag-valve mask (Ambu Mark IV-Reusable Resuscitator; Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve, an O2 line, a portable vital sign monitoring system (IntelliVue MMS X2; Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands), an infusion pump, and a portable blood gas analyzer (I-stat; Abbott, Lake Bluff, IL, USA), all transported in a single-use bag. The stock equipment of the ambulance was used for any other requirements during transport.
index 3
data Veno-venous (VV) ECMO was typically performed for the transport of patients with respiratory failure, and veno-arterial (VA) ECMO was performed for the transport of patients with heart failure. For patients with respiratory failure and hypotension, VA ECMO or veno-veno-arterial ECMO was performed. In VV ECMO, the right femoral vein was used for venous drainage and the right internal jugular vein was used for venous return. In VA ECMO, the right femoral vein and left femoral artery were utilized. Cannulation was performed using the Seldinger technique under ultrasonic guidance. The most commonly used cannulas were the FEM-FLEX2 femoral cannula (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) and the DLP femoral cannula (Medtronic, Fridley, MN, USA). The EBS Emergency Bypass System ECMO machine (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was used in 7 patients and the Quadrox PLS ECMO machine (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany) was used in the other 11 patients. The cannulas were tightly fixed to the patient’s body to prevent decannulation during transport. Once ECMO was initiated, ECMO flow and O2 flow were adjusted to determine the ECMO support flow required for transport. Ventilator settings were gradually lowered over 1 hour to maintain a partial pressure of O2 (PaO2) >70 mm Hg, partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) <50 mm Hg, and a saturation of peripheral O2 (SpO2) >95% at a fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) of 0.4, PEEP of 5 mm Hg, a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. Once a stable ECMO flow was established, transport was deemed feasible.
index 4
data After transport was deemed feasible, the patient’s status was confirmed by verifying the vital signs and the results of a blood gas analysis after ECMO support at 100% O2 and 10 L/min application of an Ambu-bag (Ambu Mark IV-Reusable Resuscitator, Ambu A/S) for 15 minutes. At that point, the charge status of the ECMO machine was checked and the gas flow line was connected to a portable O2 tank. The patient’s arterial blood pressure, SpO2, and heart rate were monitored with a portable vital sign monitor, and the patient was transported from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the ambulance on the ambulance bed. Upon arriving in the ambulance, the ECMO machine was connected to the power inside the vehicle and the O2 line was connected to the ambulance O2 tank flow line. The patient’s status was observed constantly by monitoring vital signs and by visually verifying the blood color in the inflow and outflow lines. If the SpO2 dropped below 90%, the O2 tank level in the ambulance was verified and the endotracheal tube status was checked. The SpO2 was maintained above 90% by adjusting the ECMO and O2 inhalation flow. When the SpO2 of patients was lower than 90%, the PaO2, PaCO2, and pH were checked by arterial blood gas analysis using the I-stat (Abbott). When the ambulance arrived at the hospital, the patient was transported to the ICU in the same manner as during the departure, and mechanical ventilation was begun immediately. In addition, the patient continued to be monitored for hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory or metabolic acidosis. Any necessary X-ray examinations or laboratory tests were conducted and all problems were addressed accordingly.
index 5
data Eighteen patients (6 men and 12 women; average age, 41.7±21.6 years) were accommodated with our ECMO transport system. Of these, 2 patients were children. Sixteen patients were transported to our hospital for ECMO therapy and 8 of these patients required lung transplantation. Two patients were transported to other hospitals for multiple trauma management and lung transplantation. Transfer was necessitated by an acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in 7 patients (38.9%), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring lung transplantation in 1 patient (5.5%), and severe ARDS in 10 patients (55.6%). The causes of ARDS are shown in Table 2. Ten patients were candidates for lung transplantation at the time of transport. The average Murray score [4] was 3.4±0.2, and the average sequential organ failure assessment score was 12.7±1.6. All patients required inotropic agents such as norepinephrine, and the mean lactate level was 6.8±3.0 mg/dL. The average PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 57.4±11.0 and all patients met the criteria for severe respiratory failure. VV ECMO was used in 14 patients. Four patients with cardiogenic shock required VA ECMO to support cardiac function. Of those, 3 patients had right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension, and 1 had a severe pulmonary thromboembolism (Table 2).
index 6
data All transport was conducted on the ground by ambulance. The distances covered ranged from 26 to 408 km (average, 65.9±88.1 km) and the average transport time was 56.1±57.3 minutes (range, 30 to 280 minutes). All patients were transported without adverse events. There were no adverse events involving mechanical or vehicle problems during transport (average gas flow, 6.1±3.8 L/min; average blood flow, 3.5±0.7 L/min) (Table 3). All patients maintained a stable mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and O2 saturation during transfer (Table 4).
index 7
data After transport, 4 patients (22.2%) underwent lung transplantation because of ILD. Eight patients who had severe ARDS showed recovery of heart and lung function after ECMO therapy. Four patients died in the hospital. Of these, 3 patients died of multi-organ failure during in-hospital ECMO support, and 1 patient died of ventilator-associated pneumonia after successful withdrawal of ECMO. The average duration of ECMO therapy was 14.3±13.9 days and the average ICU stay was 17.7±13.9 days. A total of 13 patients (70.6%) were successfully taken off ECMO, and 11 patients (61.1%) survived.
index 8
data In most countries, the ECMO transport system is operated by the government. However, the cost of transporting makes maintenance of this service difficult, even in advanced countries with well-developed EMS systems [5,6]. In South Korea, it is a challenge to obtain funds for the establishment and consistent operation of an ECMO transport system. Despite the increasing popularity of ECMO therapy, an insufficient number of medical centers have a well-established ECMO transport system in Korea.
index 9
data In 2011, during the early planning stages, we used another country’s system as a model, but it became clear that this model could not be applied due to the limited resources available at our center, and that it would be necessary to develop our own system. We initially thought that a province would be appropriate as the transport range of our transport system due to the accessibility and utilization of medical services. Ultimately, we defined the range of ECMO transport as the area within 100 km of our hospital, and that transportation by ambulance would be the most appropriate method. Although a helicopter has the advantage of more rapid patient transport, night operation is difficult and patients would still need to be transported by ambulance to the helicopter landing area since referring hospitals do not have facilities to accommodate the use of helicopters. Additionally, helicopter transport would be extremely costly within the transport distance of 100 km. Therefore, transport by ambulance was clearly the most appropriate and cost-effective choice.
index 10
data We considered the use of a specialized ambulance dedicated to ECMO transport, similar to those used in some foreign countries. However, we were forced to use a general-service ambulance due to limited funds and the economic burden of other options for patients. Most patients needing ECMO transport require the rapid institution of ECMO, and readily available general-service ambulances were the appropriate choice. To overcome the drawbacks of a general-service ambulance, we emphasized the development of a simple and efficient transport system that would not be influenced by the type or size of the ambulance.
index 11
data Recently, ECMO has been used as a replacement for mechanical ventilation [7]. With ‘awake ECMO,’ patients with respiratory failure are treated with ECMO alone without a mechanical ventilator [8,9]. When ECMO is performed, sufficient amounts of O2 are supplied and CO2 is removed by ECMO. The notable capacity of the ECMO oxygenator for removing CO2 maintains the target blood CO2 without mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure. Therefore, patients using ECMO can maintain appropriate blood concentrations of O2 and CO2 without mechanical ventilation as long as blood flow and gas flow are well maintained. In this context, we are able to operate our interhospital transport system without a mechanical ventilator as long as ECMO flow is sufficiently maintained. In our experience, ECMO transport with Ambu-bag ventilation has been feasible in patients with respiratory failure. We have identified no difficulty in maintaining proper blood O2 and CO2 concentrations during transport.
index 12
data If a mechanical ventilator was required during transport, it would be necessary to include more O2 tanks in the transport vehicle. The time needed to prepare the equipment would impede the rapid deployment of a general-service ambulance, and the space required for the additional O2 tanks and ventilator would interfere with the activities and number of specialists riding aboard the ambulance. We believe that at least 2 ECMO experts and 2 clinical perfusionists with nursing experience are required to cope with the problems that may occur during transport. It is more beneficial to the patient’s well-being to carry a proper number of transport team specialists who can rapidly correct any problems during transport than to use the space inside a general-service ambulance for a mechanical ventilator.
index 13
data In conclusion, our ECMO transport system with Ambu-bag ventilation can be considered a safe and useful interhospital transport method for respiratory failure patients. This interhospital transport system can be established without a financial burden on the developing organization and is a good alternative option for ECMO interhospital transport systems in Korean hospitals with limited resources. The establishment of an organized and effective public health system is needed for more stable ECMO interhospital transport.
index 14
data This study is restricted in that it involved a limited number of patients, and more importantly, this is a retrospective and non-comparative study targeting high-risk patients, for which the conditions for establishing a control group were not favorable.

data The 2014–2015 West African outbreak of EVD claimed the lives of more than 11 000 people and infected over 27 000 across seven countries.1 One entry into the human population is thought responsible for all cases seen.2 Reported case fatality rates ranged from 31% to 74% for observed cohorts.3–5
index 0
data Prior to this outbreak, EVD had infected under 2500 people in ∼30 outbreaks since its discovery in 1976.6 Each previous outbreak was rural, limited to <500 cases, and controlled through standard response interventions such as contact tracing, rapid case identification and isolation and infection control measures.7 In West Africa, these traditional approaches to containing EVD proved inadequate due to rapid transmission across densely populated communities with good transport infrastructure, and across national borders.8 New approaches for controlling the outbreak were, therefore, required.
index 1
data Many different types of EVD care facilities were established in Sierra Leone during the 2014–2015 West African response to the EVD outbreak, each implemented differently by different partners. In Sierra Leone, facilities could be broadly categorised into three models. Traditional Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) were usually large purpose-built facilities with sizeable medical and nursing teams that undertook long-term EVD care for confirmed patients with EVD, until death or discharge. These were often operated by international organisations with independent supply chains, and usually had a smaller distinct area for isolation and testing of suspect patients. EHUs were isolation units established in existing health facilities that undertook screening, testing, and initial treatment; these were largely implemented and staffed by local healthcare workers (HCWs), with varying amounts of international support. Community Care Centres were mainly established in rural areas; these were smaller and usually standalone temporary units that also attempted wider community engagement and social mobilisation, again with varying degrees of international assistance. Versions of these models were used throughout affected countries in West Africa during the EVD response, but with significant variations. Therefore, when these terms are used in this paper they refer specifically to the Sierra Leonean context. None of these models were intended to work in isolation. Each model was intended to work in collaboration with the other models, with each having a distinct role.
index 2
data The ideal response to an EVD outbreak with an exponential increase in cases is flexible, readily deployable, and replicable.9 High levels of infection prevention and control practices are needed to ensure patient and staff safety, to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection, and prevent health facilities acting as amplifiers of the outbreak.10 The response should be accessible to patients and promote effective community engagement necessary to overcome stigma and fear. It should act to help general healthcare services reduce the high levels of non-EVD mortality attributed to an outbreak,11 and reduce the high levels of HCW infections.12 It should be sustainable and ideally contribute to building more resilient healthcare and outbreak response systems. Resilience in a health system has been defined as ‘the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and, informed by lessons learned during the crisis, reorganise if conditions require it.’13 Finally, it should limit EVD-associated deaths and be suited to a low resource environment with low financial costs for both start-up and maintenance, and with resilience in HCW staffing.
index 3
data This article describes the EHU model developed and implemented by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) and King's Sierra Leone Partnership (KSLP) (box 1) in Freetown, Sierra Leone, since March 2014. We discuss the role of EHU within government hospitals in Sierra Leone in relation to these ideal characteristics of EVD response, the relevance of EHUs in future EVD outbreaks, and the role of EHUs within the portfolio of delivery platforms that are necessary to respond to EVD outbreaks.
Box 1Description of King's Sierra Leone Partnership (KSLP)King's Health Partners (KHP) is one of six UK academic health science centres. Since January 2013, KSLP has been led by KHP in-country staff, and supported by academic, clinical and administrative staff from across KHP alongside focused short-term trips by subject experts and international volunteers. KSLP aims to strengthen the health system across a number of domains: clinical services; health professional training and education; and policy development that are underpinned by cross-cutting research through its support of Connaught Hospital (the country's only adult referral hospital), the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS), and the College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences. In March 2014, KSLP was invited by MOHS to contribute to the national Ebola Case Management Taskforce. The team built on existing documents to help develop national hospital guidelines for triaging patients, and developing safe isolation and testing.14 KSLP helped establish Ebola Holding Units attached to MOHS hospitals, advised other facilities on preparedness, trained staff and supported a command and control centre for managing caseload in hospitals across the Western Area of Sierra Leone.
index 4
data The MOHS, with the support of KSLP and other international partners, established EHUs at hospitals in Freetown in May 2014, before the country's first case of EVD. The original protocols for these units were adapted from pre-existing WHO international guidelines on EVD.15 Initially a two-bed EHU at Connaught Hospital was opened. Connaught Hospital played a crucial role in transporting patients before the Western Area Ebola Response Centre and its ambulance fleet were fully established. As the outbreak escalated in Freetown in August 2014, KSLP and MOHS increased Connaught Hospital bed capacity to 9, then to 16 beds with two child cots, and later opened four further units in Freetown and supported the construction of two others. Advice and clinical support were also provided to several other centres on an ad hoc basis. The EHUs were located within the grounds of government hospitals, either within newly-built adjacent structures or repurposed existing buildings. All patients were screened for EVD at the entrance and directed as appropriate to the general wards, outpatient clinics or the EHU. The EHUs isolated screened or referred suspect patients, provided initial clinical care, undertook laboratory testing to confirm EVD status, referred onward positive cases to an ETC or negative cases to the general wards, and safely stored corpses pending collection by burial teams (see figure 1).
index 5
data There are four main goals behind the development of EHUs situated within or adjacent to existing health facilities where cases are likely to present. These are:16
Reduction of cases in the local community: through rapid isolation of symptomatic and suspect EVD cases to prevent onward transmission, with prevention of nosocomial transmission through patient separation and regular decontamination of surfaces and floors.Improved survival of isolated patients: through provision of safe medical care, including antimalarial and antimicrobial treatment, encouragement and assistance to eat and drink, regular assessment of hydration and clinical status, and symptomatic pain and sickness relief.Maintenance of general non-EVD healthcare: through prompt diagnosis of EVD and onward transfer of patients to dedicated ETCs, alongside the exclusion of EVD and triage of negative patients into outpatient or inpatient facilities for general care. This allows for the essential continuation of paediatric vaccination, maternal and child health, HIV and tuberculosis programmes and general medical and emergency surgical care within the hospitals. This is only possible through screening at point of entry into the healthcare facility to reduce the risk of EVD introduction into the outpatient or ward environment.Reduction in healthcare worker infections: through staff training inside the EHU, and infection prevention and control strengthening on general wards. This is not only an important goal in its own right but is also essential for avoiding closure of facilities, and thereby achieving goal three given above.
index 6
data The MOHS had overall strategic leadership of the EHUs at all times and took responsibility for: making buildings or space available for the facility; posting local health workers and cleaning staff; paying hazard pay and staff salaries; providing personal protective equipment and medical supplies; and ensuring that support functions, including ambulances, laboratory transport and testing, and burial teams, were available.
index 7
data KSLP (with the support of other organisations, such as the international non-governmental organisation GOAL for construction) worked with local colleagues to: design and construct the facility; train local staff on safety and patient care; develop local clinical pathways; oversee clinical care and troubleshoot problems or difficult cases; develop administrative systems such as stock systems and patient records; provide additional manpower (particularly at the physician level) and role-modelling; and provide additional medical supplies, where items were not available or in short supply through the government supply chain.
index 8
data There were regular assessments of safety, efficiency and quality of care conducted jointly by the MOHS, KSLP and independent specialist agencies such as the WHO and US Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). All sites were regularly assessed by KSLP over three domains: infection prevention and control; clinical care; and operational performance.
index 9
data Integration within the wider Ebola response was essential and the Government of Sierra Leone, with the support of KSLP and other agencies, established a Western Area Ebola Response Centre on 8 September 2014 that, among other activities, directed case management flow. This coordinated the transfer of suspect cases from the community and from facilities already at capacity into EHUs, communicated laboratory results with facilities, synchronised transfers of confirmed patients with EVD to treatment centres or burial teams, and informed relevant surveillance networks. It also allowed for early warning of potential problems at peripheral EHU sites.
index 10
data Between 29 May 2014 and 19 January 2015, our five EHUs had isolated ∼37% (1159) of the 3097 confirmed cases within Western Urban and Rural districts17 before transfer to dedicated ETCs for onward management. Figure 2 highlights the construction of these EHUs at a time when cases were exponentially increasing in Sierra Leone, particularly in the Western Area, from early July 2014; figure 3 shows their physical location. On average, nearly half (45%) of all isolated suspects were EVD-positive, with limited discriminatory features seen in cases.18 A further 1412 patients were tested, and either discharged or entered the general medical system for onward care. Nosocomial transmission of EVD within the EHUs appears to be lower than that previously documented at other facilities during the outbreak,19 with a positive readmission rate of 1–3% across all units (Ministry of Health and Sanitation and King's Sierra Leone Partnership—unpublished operational data). All eight staff infections were fully investigated by the CDC HCW infection team—one was attributed to a break in personal protective equipment (PPE) on opening a medication vial, one to inadequate decontamination, two due to provision of medical care outside of the EHU, and the others thought to be associated with community transmission outside of their role in the hospital. Total construction costs of all sites was <$50 000 for 79 beds. Start-up times were rapid, with average lead times of 1 week for units to become operational (see table 1). Staffing was in the main performed by local HCWs and cleaners, though Connaught Hospital, the principle adult referral hospital in the country, received more support in terms of international staffing and operational input than the other units. These were largely supervised by one or two international staff who regularly visited and maintained telephone communication with the site supervisors.15
index 11
data Our experience demonstrated that EHUs can be a safe and effective model of care that has a number of key strengths. By co-locating EHUs in existing medical facilities, these were able to detect new chains of transmission by screening walk-in patients who had a non-specific febrile illness and were seeking general health services. Screening and early isolation of these patients protected both HCWs and patients without EVD from nosocomial transmission on the general wards. This enabled the health facilities to remain open for non-EVD emergency care for the duration of the protracted outbreak, whereas many other health facilities without EHUs had to be closed down. For example, before the construction of the EHU at Rokupa Government Hospital, the hospital had 11 HCW infections in 3 weeks. After construction of the EHU at this hospital, there were none.
index 12
data Suspected patients who tested negative for EVD but had another serious illness (such as appendicitis or life-threatening complications of HIV) could immediately access further inpatient or outpatient care within the same facility. Our experience was that the EHUs were safe for staff and patients, provided reliable diagnoses and initiated early bundles of care covering a variety of likely pathologies (P Arkel, D Youkee, CS Brown, et al. Quantifying the risk of nosocomial infection within Ebola Holding Units: a retrospective cohort study of negative patients discharged from five Ebola Holding Units in Western Area, Sierra Leone. Paper submitted to Tropical Medicine & International Health; March 2016).
index 13
data The EHU model has system-wide benefits. Using existing facilities meant that EHUs could be deployed early in the outbreak, and rapidly constructed.20 Start-up times were rapid due to the benefits of utilising existing logistics, waste management facilities and staffing schedules. It was much less expensive to adapt existing structures than to build new sites. Together these reduced resourcing requirements, such as capital expenditure or international or national health workers, which freed up resources to be deployed elsewhere. The use of existing supply chain and other government systems reduced the need for parallel structures that were expensive and challenging to establish, and risked undermining local long-term systems. Leadership of the EHUs by the MOHS and local HCWs could be maintained, thereby building up local institutional capacity and helping to ensure local ownership and community acceptance. Integration within the MOHS allows the EHUs to coordinate effectively with other aspects of outbreak response, thus strengthening the health system alongside the EVD response.
index 14
data EHUs also demonstrated flexibility and could be adapted as the epidemic grew and receded. In EVD endemic countries, such as Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, sporadic re-emergence is an ongoing concern. Capacity must remain to isolate, test and treat EVD: this must be responsive, scalable and adaptive to local epidemiology. The EHU model works well within a resilience framework.13 These can be diverse; in Freetown, they were located at primary and secondary care facilities as well as specialist centres for obstetrics, paediatrics and psychiatry. They can be multifunctional and adaptive, allowing for the isolation and screening of other potential outbreaks such as cholera, Marburg or Lassa fever; it might not be feasible to manage diseases transmitted through the airborne route, such as Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS), as different infection control methods are required. They can easily be reactivated to enable EVD care with trained, on-site staff if and when the need should arise. The hub and spoke model, using Connaught as a base, allowed for resilience and staff support and training from a central site.
index 15
data Our experience also showed that the EHU model has important limitations. The EHUs usually only provided isolation, diagnosis, and early treatment but then had to refer confirmed cases to ETUs for further care. Where no ETU beds were available, patients sometimes had to travel for up to 6 hours by ambulance to remote ETU facilities, which most likely had a detrimental impact on their outcomes. The medical care available to patients, while meeting national and international standards, was relatively limited; the EHUs did not have the capacity to provide all patients with intravenous fluids or have access to novel therapeutics that were being trialled. These challenges were not unique to EHUs, but there were some factors about this model that made certain procedures more difficult or risky for staff: utilising existing buildings limited the ability to optimise layout and infection control processes; and EHUs operated with much lower staffing numbers compared to other types of facility, as well as relying largely on government health workers who were often less well paid or highly qualified than international counterparts. Higher staff to patient ratios and more senior supervision for staff would enable higher standards of care to be provided, and indeed this was achieved at some EHUs later in the outbreak.
index 16
data The EHUs were most useful in an urban setting, where there was easy direct patient access to a secondary or tertiary care facility: they were able to pick up and detect new cases that presented to hospital in a setting where contact tracing was very challenging; they could utilise existing buildings in areas where there was little or no open ground for tented facilities; and could be established early in an outbreak and be kept open for long periods with minimal resources, which was important as new chains of transmission can rapidly be brought into urban hubs from rural areas with little notice. While EHUs are still relevant for hospitals in rural areas, community-based models of care may have a more significant role in this context. The function of EHUs was largely restricted to medical interventions, with limited involvement in community sensitisation or contact tracing. The use of pre-existing infrastructure sometimes meant that optimal layout was difficult to achieve and compromise was often necessary, such as having to locate incinerators or screening points at sites distant from the isolation beds. However, sites did often have appropriate physical locations, for example by being adjacent to entrances, for ease of entry into the EHU from screening areas.
index 17
data The use of existing systems, such as medical supply chain and risk allowance, had benefits; however, this could also add pressure to an overstretched system and create challenges. Managing this required effective collaboration with government partners, flexibility (eg, switching to different types of PPE, when necessary), and proactive troubleshooting when problems arose. Ultimately this worked well but we were unable to eliminate the need for parallel systems completely; for example, we needed a supplementary supply chain for some items, and there were still challenges. These included staff strikes due to lack of hazard pay. Similarly, the partnership approach involved more stakeholders (local hospital, supporting partner, MOHS, donor) and this could make decision-making slower and more challenging. Managing this required trust, good communication, mutual empathy and strong, and sustained leadership from all sides.
index 18
data Overall we believe the EHU model achieved the four goals set out in the introduction above, although given the chaotic, multidimensional and rapidly evolving nature of the outbreak and the lack of good data it is difficult to prove this or unequivocally show a causal relationship. The EHUs will have significantly reduced the number of cases in the community, given that 1159 EVD cases were isolated in EHUs from the community in the Western Area at a time when no other isolation beds were available.21 The nosocomial transmission rates in EHUs have been shown to be extremely low and were certainly lower than would have been achieved in a general hospital setting. We believe that EHUs in Sierra Leone made an important contribution to reducing EVD transmission. There is no data on survival rates of patients with EVD who were isolated in EHUs compared to those remaining in the community or presenting to other forms of facility; however, since all suspected patients were immediately started on treatments (such as oral rehydration and antibiotics) that are known to reduce EVD mortality, and since these were largely unavailable in the community and there were no available beds elsewhere, we can infer that EHUs reduced mortality for patients with EVD. Some, but not all, general health services were maintained in hospitals with EHUs; the Connaught Hospital Emergency Department remained open and general medicine wards remained largely at capacity during the outbreak, although other services were significantly reduced, such as elective surgeries which were reduced by 97%. The extent to which general health services were maintained varied between departments and across different hospitals, and varied over time. However, hospitals with EHUs were more likely to remain open. For instance, the Ola during Children's Hospital (the equivalent paediatric hospital to Connaught Hospital in Freetown) closed completely for 2 months from September to November 2014 until an EHU was established and the hospital was reopened. There were similar closures of hospitals in Monrovia, Liberia. The reduction of health worker mortality is a complex issue: many hospitals without an effective EHU saw high levels of health worker infections and these infections reduced significantly when an EHU was opened (as demonstrated above at Rokupa Hospital). However, the health worker infection rate was not eliminated completely in hospitals with an EHU; since it is likely that the hospitals would have closed without an EHU and staff would have remained at home, it could be argued that EHUs kept staff at risk. However, many health worker infections occurred when health workers provided informal care in the community (which would likely have increased if hospitals had closed) and without EHUs, the overall scale of the outbreak would likely have been greater (putting everyone in the community, including health workers, at increased risk). We believe that our data supports the claim that EHUs largely achieved their goals.
index 19
data We learned a number of important lessons from our involvement in the response to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. An effective and resilient health system is the cornerstone of any response to a health crisis and it is essential to invest in getting the basics right when times are good, before the emergency. We were too slow to challenge some of the conventional wisdom from previous outbreaks, particularly the belief that EVD would not cause major urban outbreaks. The Government of Sierra Leone and its partners ultimately did shift into emergency mode, but we could have moved from a ‘development’ mindset to a ‘humanitarian’ one more quickly, spending greater resources more rapidly, reducing bureaucracy, suspending non-critical activities and adopting a different relationship and form of communication with partners. We demonstrated that government services, including the public health system, are not only capable of playing a safe and central role in a health crisis and humanitarian emergency but are the fastest and most efficient way of doing so. We believe that supporting government health facilities as the primary responders to a crisis should be the starting place of any international relief efforts through close collaboration. Crises often become protracted and are likely to recur in future. However, funding for any response soon starts to dry up once the height of the emergency is over; it is, therefore, advisable to plan for the long term even from the beginning, such as building permanent facilities or training local health workers. Finally, good command and control can enable a far more effective use of existing resources. For example, maximising the use of existing bed capacity is more effective than building more beds, but this requires up-to-date operational data and clear protocols for decision-making.
index 20
data We found that in Sierra Leone, EHUs were a flexible and effective model of care to achieve rapid diagnosis, safe isolation, and early initial treatment before referral of confirmed patients with EVD to ETCs. We also demonstrated that it is possible for international partners and government facilities to collaborate closely during a humanitarian crisis. We believe our experience is a successful example of how outbreak response can be integrated into pre-existing health systems, and how the government and international partners can collaborate in an integrated fashion. This approach had the advantages of being quick to establish, of providing long-term resilience for managing future outbreaks, and for building broader capacity in the health sector.

data Acute respiratory tract infection is one of the most common diseases encountered in the outpatient and/or Emergency Department settings in childhood1). Of these infections, bronchiolitis is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among young children23). According to an epidemiologic study, approximately 100,000 bronchiolitis hospitalizations occur annually in the United States4). Another study looking at 1,503,239 children under 18 years of age who visited the Emergency Department in Korea in 2012 found that 18,313 children (1.2%) were diagnosed with bronchiolitis and 6,321 children of them (34.5%) were admitted5).
index 0
data In a clinical setting, clinicians often perform chest radiography on children with typical manifestations of bronchiolitis in order to rule out other diseases such as pneumonia or cardio-pulmonary diseases. For example, a survey of clinical practices in the diagnosis and management of 17,397 children with bronchiolitis reported that 72% of them received chest radiographs6). Accordingly, there are several studies demonstrating that the majority of these chest radiographies done on children with bronchiolitis were read as negative and thus of little clinical use678910). However, there are no studies determining the proportion of children with pathologic chest radiographic findings in Korean children admitted with bronchiolitis. Furthermore, there are only 3 studies in the literature reporting risk factors for radiographic abnormalities among young children with bronchiolitis7910). Determining the proportion of children with pathologic chest radiographic findings and understanding these risk factors could help clinicians reduce the number of chest X-rays and thus avoid unnecessary radiation exposure for children.
index 1
data In the present study, we aimed to determine the proportion of chest radiographs showing pathologic findings inconsistent with bronchiolitis and the clinical predictors of pathologic chest radiographic findings in young children admitted with a typical presentation of bronchiolitis to an inpatient Pediatric Unit at a general hospital.
index 2
data This was a retrospective chart review study of all young children hospitalized in the CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University from January 2011 through December 2012 with typical clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis. Young children who met the following criteria were included: (1) children <2 years of age and (2) those presenting with typical clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis: i.e., a constellation of clinical signs and symptoms such as a viral upper respiratory prodrome followed by increased respiratory effort and wheezing11). A total of 378 young children were admitted with bronchiolitis during the study period.
index 3
data Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) young children who were infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, determined as an initial indirect microparticle agglutinin technique (Serodia-Myco II, Fujirebio, Osaka, Japan) (titer of >1:320) or a 4-fold increasing titer on repeat specimens and positive results for anti-Mycoplasma IgM12), (2) young children whose caregivers did not answer questionnaires on the patient's past and parental history at the time of hospitalization, (3) young children who were born <37 weeks gestational age, or (4) young children who had a cardiac problem. Finally, 279 young children were included in the study (Fig. 1). Clinical factors collected at the time of admission included sex, age, the presence or absence of fever, laboratory data, and previous hospitalization for respiratory illnesses. We reviewed chest X-rays of children with previous admission due to respiratory illnesses and confirmed that their chest X-rays normalized prior to the current illness. On admission, all subjects underwent routine chest X-ray; blood samples were taken from subjects, and laboratory assessment such as complete blood count, absolute neutrophil count, total eosinophil count, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were performed. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University, Seoul, Korea (approval number: GCI-16-23).
index 4
data All radiographs were read at admission by physicians and at a later date by a highly experienced radiologist, who is regarded as an expert in pediatric lung diseases (HKC). A second senior staff radiologist (THK) also read the initial 279 radiographs to confirm the “expert” reading. Both study radiologists acknowledged that the children were hospitalized due to respiratory tract illnesses, but were blinded to the details of presentation and the findings of the other participating radiologist.
index 5
data Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were collected at the time of hospitalization by carefully irrigating the young child's nostrils with sterile saline solution. Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were analyzed within 24 hours of aspiration for respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) (A and B), human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus (A, B, and C), coronavirus (A and B), and adenovirus. Total viral RNA was obtained from nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (300 µL) by utilizing Viral Gene-spin Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kits (iNtRON, Seongnam, Korea) and stocked at −80℃. First-strand cDNA was manufactured by implementing Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kits (Fermentas Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada), followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Seeplex Respiratory Viruses Detection Kits-1 (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) and the GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). All reaction mixtures (20 µL) consisted of 3 µL of cDNA, 4 µL of 5× RV1A or 5× RV1B primer, and 10 µL of 2× Multiplex Master Mix. In short, 2.5 µL of extracted RNA was incorporated with 5× buffer, 0.2mM of each dNTP, 0.5µM of each primer13141516), 1 µL of the enzyme mix, and diethylpyrocarbonate-incorporated ultrapure water to a total volume of 25 µL. After being incubated at 50℃ for 30 minutes and at 94℃ for 15 minutes, the reactions underwent 40 cycles of denaturation for 30 seconds at 94℃, annealing for 90 seconds at 60℃, and extension for 90 seconds at 72℃, followed by a final extension at 72℃ for 10 minutes. The amplified specimens were analyzed on 2% agarose gels comprised of 0.5-g/mL ethidium bromide.
index 6
data The chest radiographic findings were divided into benign or pathologic groups17). Benign chest radiographic findings were defined as those consistent with uncomplicated bronchiolitis: normal chest radiographs, symmetric hyperinflation, parahilar peribronchial infiltrates, and diffuse interstitial markings17). Pathologic chest radiographic findings included infiltrates, atelectasis, cardiac abnormalities, foreign bodies, masses, and congenital anomalies17).
index 7
data The sample size was assessed for a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the primary outcome. After discussion by the researchers, we assessed the percentage of children with benign chest radiographic findings (i.e., bronchiolitis) and pathologic chest radiographic findings to be ≤3%±2%, with alpha=0.05 and beta=0.2, which produced a total required number of children with bronchiolitis of 26018).
index 8
data Data are expressed as median (interquartile range) or number (%) unless otherwise mentioned. Differences between groups were compared by implementing the Mann-Whitney U tests or the chi-square tests, when appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was incorporated to determine clinical risk factors for pathologic chest radiographic findings; independent variables were sex (male), age under 3 months, the presence of fever, hs-CRP>0.3 mg/dL, and a history of admission for respiratory illness. Birth weight, height, and head circumference; gestational age; respiratory rate, heart rate, and body temperature at admission; oxygen saturation at admission; duration of fever; hs-CRP; white blood cell count; and total eosinophil count were utilized as continuous variables. Sex, age under 3 months, the presence of fever at admission, hs-CRP (>0.3 mg/dL), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a history of admission for respiratory illnesses, chest retraction, and wheezes were categorical variables. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 21.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). All statistical tests were two-sided, with a P value of less than 0.05 showing statistical significance.
index 9
data The study population consisted of 279 children. The median age of the children was 8 months. Approximately 41% of the study subjects were male. The numbers of patients that had chest retraction and wheezing were 41 (14.7%) and 149 (53.4%), respectively. The median hospital stay was 4 days (1–14 days), and the number of children who received antibiotic therapy was 191 (68.5%). Only 26 of 279 children (9.3%) had pathologic chest radiographic findings on chest radiograph; of them, 24 children had opacities and two children had atelectasis.
index 10
data There were no differences between groups with regard to sex; age; birth weight, height, or head circumference; gestational age; respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature, or oxygen saturation at admission; the presence of fever prior to admission; duration of fever prior to admission; the presence of chest retraction or wheezes; white blood cell count or total eosinophil count at admission; or virus detected. The total duration of fever (3 [0–5] days vs. 1 [0–3] day, P=0.007), hs-CRP (1.4 [0.4–4.1] mg/dL vs. 0.4 [0.1–1.4] mg/dL, P=0.02), hs-CRP (>0.3 mg/dL) (21/26 [80.8%] vs. 140/253 [55.3%], P=0.01) and a history of admission for respiratory illnesses (8/26 [30.8%] vs. 28/253 [11.1%], P=0.004) were significantly higher in children with pathologic chest radiographic findings than in those with benign chest radiographic findings (Table 1).
index 11
data Table 2 compares the respiratory viruses identified in the study subjects with pathologic and those with benign chest radiographic findings. RSV was identified in 6 subjects (23.1%) in the children with pathologic chest radiographic findings and 57 (22.5 %) in those with benign chest radiographic findings; human rhinovirus in 3 (11.5%) and 12 (4.7%), respectively; and human metapneumovirus in 1 (3.8%) and 7 (2.8%), respectively. There were no differences in the incidence of each virus between the groups (P>0.05 each).
index 12
data The diagnostic performance of hs-CRP levels (>0.3 mg/dL) was a sensitivity of 80.8% (95% CI, 60.7–93.5), specificity of 48.5% (95% CI, 42.5–54.6), positive predictive value of 13.0% (95% CI, 8.3–19.2), and negative predictive value of 96.4% (95% CI, 91.7–98.8) for predicting pathologic chest radiographic findings.
index 13
data We utilized multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine clinical predictors of pathologic chest radiographic findings in children admitted with the typical presentation of bronchiolitis. Multivariate logistic regression analyses results determined that after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including sex and age, pathologic chest radiographic findings were significantly positively associated with hs-CRP (>0.3 mg/dL) and a history of admission due to respiratory illnesses (Table 3).
index 14
data In the present study, we aimed to determine the proportion of children with pathologic chest radiographic findings and the clinical predictors in young children hospitalized for bronchiolitis at a general hospital. We were able to demonstrate that the majority of children (90.7%) admitted with the typical presentation of bronchiolitis showed benign chest radiographic findings at admission; however, those with high hs-CRP levels at admission or a history of admission due to respiratory illnesses prior to the current admission were approximately 1.2 times more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings.
index 15
data Subjects with bronchiolitis may also have pneumonia detected by chest X-ray78910). A previous study analyzing patients less than 24 months of age admitted via the emergency department with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis found that 15 subjects out of 122 patients (12.3%) showed abnormal chest X-ray findings such as atelectasis or consolidation8). Another study assessing 410 chest radiographs performed on children admitted with bronchiolitis through the Emergency Department suggested that 40 (9.7%) were considered abnormal7), a number similar to our finding of 9.3%. A previous study determined that young children with oxygen saturation ≤92% or a Respiratory Disease Assessment Instrument (RDAI) clinical score ≥10 of 17 points were more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings than their counterparts10). Another study found that body temperature ≥38℃ and oxygen saturation <94% were associated with infiltrates/atelectasis9). Finally, a recent study reported that the presence of fever was the only significant clinical predictor of radiographic abnormalities among their cohort7). In contrast to previous studies, we did not find fever or hypoxia to be a risk factor for chest abnormalities. We found that high hs-CRP levels at admission or a history of admission due to respiratory illnesses prior to the current admission were clinical factors predicting pathologic radiographic findings in this cohort. This discrepancy may be ascribed to differences in characteristics of the populations such as age, seasons during which the tests were performed, or causative agents.
index 16
data hs-CRP is a well-established biomarker that is used on a regular basis in clinical settings. It is an acute-phase serum protein in humans, and its level rises rapidly due to the cytokines released in response to infection and inflammation19). However, it has traditionally been viewed as inadequately accurate for use in the diagnosis of pneumonia, because almost all infective, autoimmune, metabolic, ischemic, and neoplastic disorders are associated with increased serum hs-CRP levels20). Nonetheless, several previous research works have corroborated the idea that it may have a diagnostic value in detecting pneumonia21) and disease severity22) in adults and in children23). Similar to previous research, we determined that a high hs-CRP level at admission is an independent clinical predictor of pathologic chest radiographic findings in this cohort of young children with bronchiolitis and has a high negative predictive value of 96.4%, indicating that if the subject's hs-CRP is less than 0.3 mg/dL at admission, the probability that the subject has a benign chest radiographic finding is high. However, it should be noted that the current practice guideline states that laboratory studies should not be obtained routinely on children with bronchiolitis24). In this regard, we speculate that hs-CRP could be used as a biomarker to help clinicians determine whether a chest X-ray should be performed only in cases where blood samples are obtained.
index 17
data A history of hospitalization due to respiratory illness is an important aspect of the history in children with respiratory problems in the outpatient department, as the respiratory signs and symptoms in children with previous respiratory problems tend to worsen, ultimately requiring hospitalization25). This may be due to the fact that these subjects have chronic respiratory illnesses such as asthma, thus predisposing them to developing severe respiratory illness. However, unfortunately, we did not evaluate every patient's asthma history and their family history of asthma.
index 18
data There are some limitations to the present study. First, the current study has inherent limitations due to its retrospective study design. Second, the present study is a single center study conducted at a secondary hospital. Third, lung function measures or objective assessments such as the RDAI clinical score were not available to determine the degree of respiratory difficulty. Fourth, this study lacks a diagnostic “gold standard” to prove the absence of bacterial infection in children with chest abnormalities. It would be ideal to perform chest radiography after a complete review of the expected benefits of chest X-ray in subjects (e.g., subjects with toxic appearance, unconventional presentations, or protracted clinical course). Furthermore, the current research work had only 2 children with atelectasis on their chest x-ray, and recognition of any factors predicting this high-risk finding was beyond calculation.
index 19
data In conclusion, we found that chest radiographs in young children with a typical presentation of bronchiolitis have limited value; however, those with high hs-CRP levels or a history of admission due to respiratory illnesses prior to admission were approximately 1.2 times more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings. Further studies with larger samples sizes are needed to corroborate this finding before a clear conclusion can be drawn.

data Falls are the leading cause of non-fatal injury in children and adolescents that impose significant burdens to the individuals and society.1–4 Previous studies have established an injury profile of Hong Kong, stating that over 40% of the child injuries were due to falls.5
6 Fall-related injuries in childhood and adolescence may induce severe complications, such as traumatic brain injuries,7 serious head injuries8 and permanent disability,9 that adversely affect the future development and productivity of the children and adolescents. These would impose considerable burden to the healthcare system.10 The substantial impact of children and adolescent falls to the society can be reflected by the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. Globally, falls have been reported as the 13th most common cause of DALYs lost, of which children and adolescents accounted for over 50% of the fall-related DALYs lost.11
index 0
data Given the high prevalence and substantial adverse effects of falls among children and adolescents, more efforts should focus on the preventive measures. However, different types and severity of fall-related injuries make the allocations of corresponding resources of fall-related injuries difficult. Hence, it is necessary to explore the mechanisms and potential factors that contribute to fall-related injury risks during childhood in order to inform the prevention programme design and implementation.
index 1
data Falls have been identified as the most common cause of attendances to the accident and emergency department (AED) among all childhood injuries.12 Data on AED attendances and hospitalisation serve as key indicators to reflect on the severity and pattern of fall-related injuries. As hospital care represents the most expensive component of a healthcare system,13 making use of these information can help to identify the actual burden for different types of fall-related injuries caused in terms of the frequency of AED visit and the length of stay (LOS) in hospital admission. Moreover, data sources such as death registry can provide insightful information on the pattern of mortality causes. Hospitalisation data, together with the detailed code of diagnosis, have also been recognised as important information for assessing fall-related injuries.14
15 Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of AED attendances and hospitalisation data in quantifying the burden of fall-related injuries.13
16–18 However, many of these studies mainly focused on fall injuries among older adults or specific occupational groups. There were only few studies examining the fall-related injuries among adolescents and children, as well as the burden caused by different types of fall-related injuries to the healthcare system. This study therefore aimed to examine the trends and characteristics of fall-related AED attendance by injury type and the associated hospitalisation among children and adolescents in Hong Kong.
index 2
data Based on the number of occurrence with respect to different body regions across years, fall injury-related attendance rates could be calculated by dividing the number of episodes by the corresponding population size. The rates were represented in number per 100 000 persons for clarity.
index 3
data To examine the trend of fall-related attendance, Poisson regression model was used primarily to determine the statistical significance of changes in the number of injury across the 2 years. However, the negative binomial regression model was used in the analysis if there was overdispersion. Regardless of the distribution used, natural logarithm of midyear population sizes, log (N), of 0–19 for each year from 2001 to 2012 were used as an offset in the regression equation to adjust for the effect on varying population figures, with the following model specification:
index 4
data In the model,  is the expected number of fall-related attendance in Hong Kong in year t. Generally, the exponential of the regression coefficient () in the regression model refers to incidence risk ratio, which captures the multiplicative effect of independent variable on the response variable. Statistical significance of  would indicate that there is a multiplicative effect on the year trend towards the adjusted risk in fall-related attendance number. All results were presented as an annual percentage change ( in the fall-related attendance rates under the regression model. The 95% CIs were provided, assuming  follows a normal distribution.
index 5
data Average LOS was derived as a general indicator for severity of the fall-related injury by summing up all the LOS and divided it by the number of admissions to the inpatient care unit in the group. The LOS in inpatient care unit was ≥1 if the patient was hospitalised after diagnosis in AED. Otherwise, it was expressed as zero meaning that the patient was discharged subsequently. An overall trend of the severity was observed. Subgroup analysis was also carried out for fracture group and non-fracture group for comparison on the severity of fall-related injury. Results of the analyses with p<0.05 would be considered as statistically significant. All statistical computations were performed by using statistical software R (R for Windows, V.3.2.4).
index 6
data There were a total number of 63 557 subjects aged 0–19 who attended AED due to fall-related injury from 2001 to 2012, of which 37 498 patients were admitted to the inpatients. The number of fall-related attendance by nature and year is reported in table 1. Throughout the 12-year period of time, the annual number of attendance increased by about 17% from 4789 in 2001 to 5623 in 2012. Stratified by gender, the increase in the annual intake was 8.8% (3393–3691) in male subjects and 38% (1396–1932) in female subjects, respectively. The attendance number due to fracture dropped by 5.5% from 3135 to 2962 while that due to non-fracture injury increased by 61% from 1654 to 2661. Moreover, the proportion of fracture cases in the annual admissions dropped from 65% initially to 53% at the end of the study period. The fracture locations were mainly ‘forearm/elbow’, ‘shoulder/upper arm’ and ‘wrist/hand’, sharing 44%, 25% and 11% of the fracture cases, respectively, in 2001, and the pattern was consistent throughout the years. On the contrary, head was mainly the location where non-fracture injury occurred, owning 78% in 2001.
index 7
data The overall population size-adjusted fall-related attendance rate was significantly increased by an average of 4.45% (95% CI 3.43 to 5.47%, p<0.0001) annually throughout a 12-year time period (table 2). Stratified by gender, the annual percentage change for male subjects was 1.6% (95% CI 0.65 to 2.56%, p<0.0001) which was lower compared with female subjects at 3.56% (95% CI 2.28 to 4.85%, p<0.0001). Stratified by nature of injury, the fracture group had a significant increase of 1.31% in rate (95% CI 0.56 to 2.05%, p<0.0001) while that of the non-fracture group was also significant with an annual percentage rate as high as 9.23% (95% CI 7.07 to 11.43%, p<0.0001). In the fracture group, only forearm/elbow, wrist/hand and ankle/foot had significantly positive annual percentage change. Other subcategories of fracture group, including the majority of the less numerous locations, were insignificant. On the contrary, all non-fracture subgroups had significant positive growth rates except for shoulder/upper arm. Specifically, head had persistently the highest rate in the non-fracture group with 6.28% annual percentage rate of change (95% CI 4.36 to 8.24%, p<0.0001).
index 8
data The admissions from AED to inpatient care unit dropped from 4301 persons in 2001 to 2668 persons in 2012 (table 3). Given that the total AED cases have increased, the number of patients being discharged after visiting AED due to fall injury should have a conflicting trend with the referral cases. The immediate discharge number had a sevenfold increase to 3281 in 2012 compared with the previous number at 488. The relationship can be illustrated by the intersection of the two lines at around year 2008 in figure 1. Fracture group has shown a similar pattern in the decomposition with the overall trend (figure 2) in the sense that the referral was reducing and the immediate discharge cases were booming; however, there was no crossing of the curves. For the non-fracture group, the crossing appeared early in 2003, while the referral to inpatient has become stable beyond the intersection. The increase of the non-fracture AED cases was solely driven by the number of immediate discharge cases, as illustrated in figure 3.
index 9
data The average LOS of the referred cases in each subgroup was rather stable throughout the 12 years, showed by the levelled lines in figure 4. The average LOS among the fracture group was substantially higher than the non-fracture group. The minimum difference between the average LOS of fracture group and non-fracture group was 0.635 day/person and the maximum difference was 1 day/person.
index 10
data The current study aimed to investigate the trend and characteristics of fall injury attendances in AED and the related LOS among the induced hospitalised patients from 2001 to 2012. Over the 12 years, the number of overall fall-related attendance in Hong Kong has been increased and still remains high. Particularly, there have been a growing number of non-fracture cases, whereas the fracture cases remain fairly stable. With the shrinking population size of the children and adolescents aged 0–19 over the years from 1 559 736 to 1 230 000, the population size-standardised rates of the overall fall-related attendance have increased substantially among fracture and non-fracture groups.
index 11
data Two unusual troughs in the admission number were illustrated in figures 1–3 with one appearing during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, while another during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak.20 The drops were larger in the non-fracture group (25.9% in 2003 and 6.2% in 2009) than fracture group (10.7% in 2003 and 1.5% in 2009). Such decrements in AED admission have also been observed worldwide during these outbreaks.21 During the outbreak of highly infectious and fatal diseases, AED became a comparatively high-risk place due to the admissions of newly infected patients. We suspect that although more severe patients with fracture injury would still attend AED for medical care services given no other alternatives for treatments, less severe patients with non-fracture injury would avoid attending AED for treatment during the disease outbreak due to their fear of being infected.22
index 12
data When we broke down the overall fall-related attendance into inpatient admissions and discharge cases (table 3), it was observed that the number of admissions to inpatient care unit was dropping in both groups while the immediate discharge cases were on the rising trend across the years. The increase in the overall attendance number was driven by drastic increments in immediate discharged cases in fracture and non-fracture groups. The increase in the overall attendance was driven by drastic increments in immediate discharged cases in fracture and non-fracture groups, which could be related the health seeking behaviour of the children's carer. As shown in previous studies, accessibility, convenience,23 high availability24 and confidence in the emergency care are all potential factors that could have driven the increasing number in attendance. Moreover, guardians/carers might sometimes overestimate the severity of their children's injuries,25 causing unnecessary usage of the AED services. This may require a structural change in the resource usage of AED for falls since increasing effort was put for treatment of mild cases. Owing to the fact that overcrowding was a problem to emergency departments in Hong Kong,20 administrative measures such as providing more community care, primary care, community education and change in the admission criteria may relieve possible inappropriate usage of AED services.26
27 Nonetheless, the boom in non-fracture attendance could be explained by the enhanced awareness of the parents on the safety of their children or improvements in the reputation of AED.
index 13
data Previous research found that the most common type of fall which results in hospitalisation among 10-year olds or younger was falling from one level to another, including falling from playground equipment, beds, tables and chairs. On the contrary, patients aged 10–19 were frequently injured because of falling on the same level instead, either slipping or having collisions with others.13 In our study, while the rate of non-fracture injury admissions in all body regions increased significantly, ankle and foot injuries had the highest annual percentage change followed by wrist and hand injuries. Head injuries had the highest proportion accounting for the number of fall injury attendance in the non-fracture injuries. It escalated to about 1.6 times of its initial value over the 12-year study period. However, such escalation could be accounted by a pure increase in head incidence or an improvement in diagnostic process. Research showed that young children having minor head injuries had low risk to coincide with clinically significant traumatic brain injury.28
index 14
data Our results, as compared with a previous study, suggested that non-fractures appeared most frequently on head consistently among the young and the elderly (aged 65+). Yet, these two groups of people were different in the pattern of fracture-injured body region; the children and adolescents were most commonly injured with fractures on their upper extremity, while fractures on hips were the most common among the elderly.16 The explanation may lie on the differences in the falling mechanisms and the response time to accidents with respect to children and the elderly. Wrist fractures are usually associated with falling forward or backward with an outstretched hand while hip fractures are often due to falls to the side.29 It was suggested that wrist fractures are more common than hip fractures between ages 65 and 75. However, hip fractures become predominate in ages 75+, probably because of slowed reflexes and loss of ability to protect their hips with their hands.30 When fall occurs, the younger individuals have more available response time than the elderly, and hence they can sufficiently use their hand to land on the ground to protect their hips and prevent their heads from damages.31
32 Therefore, it is most likely to see that the fracture appeared on the parts of the upper extremity of children and adolescents.
index 15
data Figure 4 demonstrates the trend of the average LOS of hospitalised patients with fall-related attendance. It reflects that the injuries among fracture group are more severe than non-fracture group, and fracture cases impose a heavier burden on the healthcare system. Moreover, a stable trend in severity of injuries has been observed, as reflected by the average LOS. However, there might be other influential factors such as the administrative policies of hospitals that would certainly alter the LOS of patients.
index 16
data There are some limitations in our study. First, as readmissions to AED were unlikely to be separated from new admissions and be excluded easily, potential double counting may compromise our study. Second, this study only included those subjects with a principal code and without complications of medical care. Hence, the number and the rates may not accurately reflect the actual admissions for each type of injury sustained. Third, we adopted LOS as a proxy for severity of injury which has been criticised for its instability in estimating the injury severity as compared with other standardised scores. However, LOS is a readily available statistic that can be easily understood by general public and LOS can reflect the potential improvements of medical treatments and policy changes in hospital for inpatients over time, which are of interest in our study. Finally, the current study did not examine the details of how falling mechanisms would result in injury of particular body regions among children and adolescents. Fall-preventive measures may be difficult to be implemented in practice. Further study would be needed to elucidate these mechanisms in the near future.
index 17
data The study shows a surprising phenomenon that although our child and adolescent population was shrinking, the relative number of overall fall-related attendance continued to increase. It is possible that guardians/carers of children became more aware of their children's injuries, and more willing to seek professional help. Appropriate administrative measures in AED can be proposed to relieve possible inappropriate use of services and reduce the waiting time. More importantly, the increased number of childhood injuries signals the inadequacy of preventive measures for fall-related injuries. Different parties should work together and implement more effective preventive measures. For instance, schools can install soft rubber and waterproof floor for students' playgrounds, while parents can create a safe home environment for their children. A further study on disseminating safety knowledge to parents will be conducted.33 In the future, governments should coordinate different parties with appropriate public policy to protect our children from fall-related injuries.

data Flooding has been of significant concern since the beginning of human civilization and has led to extensive morbidity and mortality. Floods are the most common natural disaster worldwide and specifically in Europe; hence, a crucial area of research.1 Between 1997 and 2006, the number of global flood events doubled.2 European vulnerability to flooding has been highlighted by recent flooding events; most notably, the Central European floods in 2002 and in 2010, the 2010 flooding in Southern France, and the 2007 flooding in several areas in the United Kingdom.
index 0
data Defining what constitutes a flood can be quite complex as floods can take many forms; therefore, no universal definition exists. Generally and in the context of this review, a flood is defined as the overflow of areas that are not normally submerged with water or a stream that has broken its normal confines or has accumulated due to lack of drainage.3 Overall, different flood characteristics affect the severity of the flood event; specifically, regularity, speed of onset, velocity of flow, and depth of water. Quantifying the level of flooding has proven to be difficult; however, the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) provides information about flood events and the impact of floods. For a flood to be classified as a disaster or flood event by EM-DAT one of the criteria must be fulfilled: either ten or more people killed; 100 or more people affected; declaration of a state emergency; and/or call for international assistance. EM-DAT defines a flood as a significant rise in water level in a stream, lake, reservoir, or coastal region and includes general river floods, flash floods, and storm surges or coastal flooding.
index 1
data Flood disasters hit some European regions very frequently, and in some circumstances every year. In Europe from 2003–2012, 19 flash floods and 162 general floods were reported by EM-DAT. In terms of the number of people affected, 7 out of the 20 most important floods ever recorded in Europe occurred during the 2000–2010 decade.4 A study concluded a rising number in flood disasters from 1950–2005 in the European Union (EU).5 According to Frei et al.6 there has been a significant trend toward increased intense winter rainfall events in Europe. Other studies do not find a rising incidence of flooding. For example Mudelsee et al.7 examined river flood patterns in Central Europe, and despite the occurrence of two flood events exceeding the 100-y flood level in 1997 and 2002, found no increased trend in extreme flood frequency over recent decades. Analyzing the more frequent, small-magnitude flood events as well as high-magnitude floods can make it easier to detect shifting trends in flood frequency.6 Flood trend analysis is essential to understand future flood risk and vulnerability.
index 2
data Both climatic and non-climatic impacts, such as land-use dynamics, are expected to influence future flooding in Europe. Although considerable limitations remain in the ability to make robust projections of changes in flood size and frequency due to climate change, common projections appear to be emerging. According to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) SREX Report8 there is a 66–100% probability that the intensity of heavy precipitation and the proportion of total rainfall will increase particularly in northern mid-latitudes and high latitudes of Europe. The highest total precipitation increases are projected to occur during the winter months. Although the IPCC states a general decrease in mean precipitation in the southern European region, rainfall may become more irregular and intense. However there remains low confidence in projections of changes in riverine floods. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency of storm surges and coastal flooding due to rise in sea levels, and threaten an additional 1.6 million people per year in Europe by the 2080s.9 Overall, changes in the climate that may affect the transmission of infectious diseases include temperature, humidity, altered rainfall, and sea-level rise.
index 3
data Flooding can have a range of health impacts but this review focused solely on infectious diseases. The diseases most likely to be affected by flooding are those that require a vehicle for transfer from host to host (water-borne) or a host/vector as part of its life cycle (vector-borne).10 Flood-affected areas serve as ideal breeding grounds for pathogens and may alter vector breeding grounds and zoonotic reservoirs.11,12 Where infectious disease transmission is endemic, it can present a major public health concern following flooding.13
index 4
data The risk of infectious diseases following flooding is exacerbated by the fact many factors work together to increase incidence.14 The significance of the association between precipitation and disease is potentially amplified when considering the effects of global climate change and land use changes. Flooding can alter the equilibrium of the environment and may affect the incidence and geographic range of climate-sensitive infectious diseases. A better understanding of the associations and underlying mechanisms of infectious disease outbreaks following flooding will help support evidence-based flood policies and mitigation strategies.
index 5
data This systematic literature review aimed to identify and examine the relationship between infectious disease incidence and flooding in order to gain a better understanding of:
index 6
data Personal communications between key informants were conducted in conjunction with the literature review. The context of the questions included the current state of knowledge of the association between flooding and infectious diseases and potential solutions to mitigate the risks.
index 7
data Because flooding is a natural disaster and cannot be induced experimentally, the research evidence was unlikely to be the considered ‘gold standard’ of a systematic literature review or a randomized controlled trial. Most of the data was observational, and because of insufficient numbers of similar studies, and variation in outcome reporting no studies were excluded on the basis of study quality. A formal assessment of bias was not possible for each individual study.
index 8
data The initial search generated 7,861 relevant articles. After reviewing the abstracts, 106 full-text articles were examined in more detail for eligibility. Of these 106 articles, 38 peer-reviewed articles were found to fit the inclusion criteria. Increased infectious disease transmission and outbreaks following global flood events have been documented (Table 2). The study design and main results of all papers found meeting the inclusion criteria are listed in detail in Appendices A-D. Some articles and gray literature not meeting the specific inclusion criteria were incorporated into the conceptual framework to give a better contextual outline.
index 9
data Water-borne outbreaks are an acute aftermath of flood disasters, mainly as a result of contaminated drinking water supply. Intense precipitation can mobilize pathogens in the environment and transport them into the aquatic environment, increasing the microbiological agents on surface water.17-20 Chen et al.21 found extreme torrential rain (> 350mm) was a significant risk factor for enteroviruses (RR = 1.96; 95% CI 1.474–23.760) and bacillary dysentery (RR = 7.703; 95% CI 5.008–11.849). Globally, water-borne epidemics have shown an increasing trend from 1980–2006 which coincides with the increasing number of flood events.2 According to a global systematic literature review performed by Cann et al.17 the most common water-borne pathogens to be identified following flooding were vibrio spp The most common water-borne pathogens associated with heavy rainfall were campylobacter, followed by vibrio spp
index 10
data Appendices A, B list published studies which have reported post-flood increases in cholera, cryptosporidiosis, non-specific diarrhea, rotavirus, and typhoid and paratyphoid.22-31 Several studies have implicated excess rainfall in water-borne disease outbreaks because of the transportation of bacteria, parasites, and viruses into water systems.22 Marcheggiani et al.18 showed a potential association between flood events and a range of water-borne infectious diseases in Italy; including, legionellosis, salmonellosis, hepatitis A, and infectious diarrhea. Reacher et al.28 performed a historical cohort study following a severe flood in 2000 in Lewes, England. The risk of gastroenteritis was significantly associated with depth of flooding in people whose households were flooded (RR = 1.7; 95% CI 0.9–3.0; p for trend by flood depth = 0.04). Additionally, an outbreak of norovirus in American tourists was linked to direct exposure to floodwater contaminated with raw sewage in Germany.29
index 11
data Earlier research has shown an association between water-borne diseases and flooding in high-income countries. From 1948–1994, more than half of the water-borne disease outbreaks in the United States were preceded by heavy rainfall (p = 0.002).30 Research from Finland found that 13 water-borne disease outbreaks from 1998–1999 were associated with un-disinfected groundwater contaminated by floodwaters and surface runoff.32 Surveys in high-income countries where individuals reported their own symptoms have indicated an increase in water-borne diseases following flooding.28,30-32
index 12
data Rodent-borne diseases are climate sensitive and may increase during heavy rainfall and flooding because of altered patterns of human- pathogen- rodent contact.15 Flooding and heavy rainfall have been associated with numerous outbreaks of leptospirosis from a wide-range of countries around the world.15,21,33-48 Areas at the highest risk for leptospirosis outbreaks are those where multiple risk factors are likely to coexist; such as, increased flooding risk, rising temperatures, overcrowding, poor sanitation, poor health care, poverty, and an abundance of rats and other animal reservoirs.39 Rodent-borne pathogens can be indirectly affected by ecological determinants of food sources which have an effect on the size of rodent populations. For example, lack of garbage management and collection following flooding where rubbish is left on the streets contributes to an increased rodent population.38 Appendices A, C summarize the key studies assessing the relationship between flooding and rodent-borne diseases.
index 13
data Outbreaks of leptospirosis were observed in the Czech Republic following floods in 1997 and 2002.41,42 The rates of serologically confirmed cases of leptospirosis were three times higher than usual at 0.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants (average incidence rate is 0.3 cases/100,000 inhabitants). The first leptospirosis outbreak in Austria in July 2010, involved four athletes who swam in recreational waters during a triathlon.43 Heavy rains had preceded the triathlon (22mm). This outbreak demonstrates a risk of contracting leptospirosis in recreational waters, especially after heavy rainfall.
index 14
data In Marseilles, France the incidence of leptospirosis identified in the laboratory increased significantly between January 2001 and July 2011 (p < 0.0001).38 Between 1991 and 2003, the rate of leptospirosis incidence in southern France was very low, 0.09 cases/100,000 inhabitants. In 2008, this incidence increased to 0.25 cases/100,000 inhabitants. The first three autochthonous cases identified in Marseilles (October 2009) were preceded by heavy rainfall. The study showed the first autochthonous case was identified after a period of flooding preceded by heavy rainfall over several days (34.6mm/day; 79.2mm/day; 137mm/day with an episode of 63mm/3hr). Similarly, the other two autochthonous cases occurred during a period of high rainfall (13.6–23.8mm).
index 15
data Pellizzer et al.36 performed a sero-epidemiological study to evaluate the risk of leptospirosis in a population in Northeast Italy exposed to a severe flood event. This area is endemic for leptospirosis and exhibits and average of 4 cases/100,000 inhabitants. Seven out of 44 subjects exposed to floodwaters exhibited anti-Leptospira specific IgM antibodies and five were confirmed positive by micro-agglutination test. Re-testing a few months later found significant antibody titers greater than 100 against serovar Copenhangeni in three cases (6.8% seroconversion rate). Overall, the rate for seroconversion for leptospirosis appeared to be low, and while flooding appeared to be the sole risk factor, confirmation was not possible due to a lack of a control group.
index 16
data Ahern et al.15 reviewed earlier studies addressing flood-associated outbreaks of leptospirosis from a wide-range of countries: Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, India, Korea, Mexico, Nicaragua, Portugal, and Puerto Rico. In 1997 in the Krasnodar Territory in Russia, a severe outbreak of leptospirosis took place in connection with a high flood.49 Sanders et al.50 stated that flooding after heavy rain favors leptospires. It prevents animal urine from being absorbed into the soil or evaporating; therefore leptospires may pass directly into the surface water or persist in mud. The evidence of this review, supported by several other reviews, suggests the association between leptospirosis and flooding is fairly robust even in high-income countries.
index 17
data Precipitation changes are known to effect the reproduction, development, behavior, and population dynamics of arthropod vectors, their pathogens, and non-human vertebrate reservoirs.10 Mosquito-borne infections tend to increase with warming and certain changes in rainfall patterns. Vector-borne diseases are unlikely to be a problem during the onset phase of the flood, as many vector breeding habitats are expected to be overwhelmed by the flood waters.51 While flooding may initially wash out vector populations, they return when the waters recede. Receding flood water can provide ideal breeding habitats. Therefore, vector-borne diseases are likely to have mid-term to long-term impacts on health following flooding (Fig. 1). Vector-borne virus outbreaks are strictly determined by the presence of the pathogen and particular competent disease vectors.52 The current and future establishment of exotic mosquito species in Europe is a cause for serious concern, as the newly introduced species may already be disease vectors or could potentially become vectors.
index 18
data West Nile virus (WNV) emerged in Europe after heavy rains and flooding, with outbreaks in Romania in 1996–1997, the Czech Republic in 1997, and Italy in 1998.53 The 2002 flood in the Czech Republic resulted in mass mosquito breeding with a biting frequency peaking at 70 bites per person per minute.54 Specimens from 497 flood-affected residents were examined serologically for mosquito-borne viruses. Paired serum samples showed one Tahyna virus infection among 150 residents.
index 19
data Jiménez-Sastré et al.55 sampled dwellings in Tabasco, Mexico, post-flood for dengue fever cases and found the geographical distribution of dengue fever cases was associated with the proximity of two permanent bodies of water. Chen et al.21 found heavy precipitation was a significant risk factor for dengue fever (RR = 1.96; 95%; CI 1.53–2.52). Additionally, more non-European studies have also examined relationships between flooding and shistosomiasis, Japanese encephalitis, Ross River virus, and Rift Valley fever.21,56-58
index 20
data While evidence of vector-borne diseases associated with flooding from 2004–2012 in Europe was sparse (Appendices A, D) older studies have shown associations. In Romania, flooded basements were a significant risk factor for WNV in apartment dwellers (p = 0.01).59 In 1997, heavy rains in Moravia, Czech Republic resulted in flooding, and mosquito populations in the area amplified immediately.60 WNV activity was reported in the area. Hubálek and Halouzka61 stated environmental factors such as flooding can facilitate the re-emergence of WNV.
index 21
data Public health interventions include those made before, during, and after flooding to reduce vulnerability to infectious diseases. Interventions need to take place at a variety of levels: individual, household, community, regional, national, and international.51 The public health measures cited in the literature to reduce the risk of infectious diseases as a result of flooding focus on: risk assessments, enhanced surveillance systems, and specific prevention and control measures depending upon the type of infectious disease risk.62,63
index 22
data A rapid disease risk assessment should be conducted by a representative multi-agency group within the first week of the flood including: data on the flooded region and displaced persons, the main disease threats for the enhanced surveillance system, baseline data collection, and identification of priority interventions.62,63 During a flood event, hand-held devices that allow workers to enter and analyze data in the field can assist the rapid risk assessment.64
index 23
data Existing disease surveillance systems can be enhanced to target specific diseases or syndromes and to support timely response actions to reduce disease impact and risk of transmission.62,63 Public health teams need to establish adequate disease surveillance systems which take into account the inherent disruption of the public health infrastructure that may occur during flooding. An enhanced surveillance system should be adaptable and context-specific, monitor key epidemiological data and compare with baseline data, monitor vulnerable groups, identify any emerging outbreaks, and result in timely public health action. In high-income countries, risk assessments and surveillance systems need to be very refined to detect small differences from baseline incidence data.51
index 24
data Prevention of infectious diseases following flooding involves maintenance of health services, provision of shelter, clean water supplies, proper sanitation, regular and adequate food supply, and in some cases mass vaccination campaigns and control of disease vectors.62,63 Water and sanitation are vital elements in the transmission of water-borne diseases; hence, providing clean drinking water is a priority in the initial days following flooding. Clasen et al.65 found that household interventions were more effective in preventing diarrhea than interventions at the water-source. Interventions at the household level reviewed included: chlorination, filtration, solar disinfection, and combined flocculation and disinfection. Ejemot-Nwadiaro et al.66 found hand-washing interventions can reduce diarrhea episodes by one-third.
index 25
data Rodent control is another prevention measure that needs to be considered during flooding. The local rodent species and their behaviors should be identified, water and food storage containers should be rodent-proofed, and solid waste should be properly stored, collected, and disposed.62,63 According to Bhardwaj et al.33 prompt and vigilant fever surveillance activities in pre-flooding preparedness plans, rodent control programs, and improvement of environmental sanitary conditions may help greatly reduce leptospirosis incidence.
index 26
data Vector control can reduce disease transmission by rendering the environment unfavorable for the survival, development, and reproduction of the vector.62,63 Establishing surveillance for the introduction of new vector species could contribute substantially to vector-control. An expert should identify vectors responsible for local disease transmission, the factors that influence transmission, location of breeding ground, and which measures of control should be implemented. Local destruction of breeding sites after flooding has receded is extremely effective, so individuals should remove unused vessels and stagnant water when possible. Water storage containers need to be covered to protect from disease vectors, such as egg-laying female mosquitoes. Individuals can protect themselves against mosquito bites by using repellents during biting hours, mosquito nets, and screens in doors and windows.
index 27
data Individual and community awareness and participation is essential for successfully reducing the risk of infectious diseases following flooding. Understanding the social and cultural influences on response behavior in the time of a flood emergency is crucial to inform the design and targeting of warnings and health education messages.1
index 28
data Some studies showed the frequency of infectious diseases can increase in the weeks to months after flooding, and Figure 1 illustrates when infectious disease outbreaks following flood events are likely to occur. However, there remains scientific uncertainty about the strength of association between infectious disease incidence and flooding. Floods can cause population displacement and changes in population density, raise concern about waste management and the availability of clean water, as well as affect the availability and access to healthcare services. All of these are risk factors for an infectious disease outbreak. Kouadio et al.13 and Watson et al.67 suggested that unless there is a substantial population displacement, there is minimal risk of infectious disease transmission and outbreaks following flooding. Overall, the risk of infectious disease following flooding is context-specific, differs between countries, and is dependent upon a number of synergistic factors. Outbreaks of leptospirosis and diarrheal diseases following flooding have been documented in Europe18,28,29,34,36,38,42 but the evidence of increased incidence of vector-borne diseases following flooding is lacking because the time lag before onset can be several months.68 Past studies have indicated possible associations between vector-borne diseases and flooding in Europe.36,59-61 European residents may be exposed to these risks while traveling. Foreign relief workers can potentially introduce infectious diseases into an area affected by flooding and these workers may be susceptible to endemic diseases that are more prevalent because of the flood.
index 29
data Surveillance in flood-affected areas is fundamental to understanding the impact of flooding on infectious disease incidence. Surveillance and early warning systems may reduce current and future vulnerability. A comprehensive risk assessment could help determine priority diseases for inclusion in the enhanced surveillance system and prioritize prevention and control measures. In addition to surveillance and early warning systems to detect epidemic-prone diseases, assuring access to clean water, proper sanitation, adequate shelter, and primary healthcare services is essential.
index 30
data Despite a considerable amount of research on the relationship between infectious diseases and flooding, globally and in Europe, the body of information still remains fragmentary. Many studies attempted to collect data retrospectively, had methodological shortcomings, lacked longitudinal data/baseline health data, control groups for comparison, and measures of clear disease outcomes. The studies included in this review were mainly observational studies with widely varying quality levels and study designs. Because it is unethical to conduct experimental studies on this topic, rigorous observational studies must be continue to be undertaken. Observational studies can present particular challenges because of the unpredictability of the timing and location of floods. Reporting and recall bias was very likely in many studies. Additionally, many studies relied on data from disease surveillance systems. Obtaining relevant disease surveillance data pre-, mid-, and post- flooding is frequently challenging. Population displacement can distort the rates of comparison for infectious disease incidence. The quality and robustness of disease surveillance systems can vary from country to country, and a country with a weak disease surveillance system will probably lack pre-flood baseline data. Flood damage to pre-existing public health infrastructure can exacerbate weaknesses in a disease surveillance system. Furthermore, it is difficult to attribute an increase in infectious disease incidence solely to a flood event, and therefore this issue may be under-investigated and under-reported. Finally, this systematic review is not entirely exhaustive, and there may be many other reports in gray literature, but the quality is likely to be lower than the peer-reviewed published reports identified.
index 31
data It is important for health officials and the public to understand that exacerbation of disease risk factors contribute to infectious disease outbreaks following flooding. Population and individual vulnerability and resilience factors can worsen or mitigate infectious diseases following flooding. The community needs to be aware of actions that can facilitate or prevent infectious disease. To mitigate infectious disease risk following flooding, those involved in flood planning, response, and recovery should be aware of the results of this systematic literature review. If climate change causes more floods, then the future health burden of infectious diseases from floods could increase. In Europe, maintenance and continuous adaptation and improvement of public health measures is important to sustain the low risk of infectious disease outbreaks following floods. Presently, there are clear research needs to improve the understanding of the association between infectious diseases and flooding:

data Despite an international consensus about the importance of CHWs to healthcare delivery, a universal definition of CHWs remains evasive. Ambiguity further abounds in the mainstream literature on the characterisation of CHWs.21 However, during the recent United States Agency for International Development (USAID) CHW Evidence Summit, there was some consensus that a CHW is “A health worker who receives standardized training outside the formal nursing or medical curricula to deliver a range of basic health, promotional, educational, and mobilization services and has a defined role within the community system and larger health system”.22 We find this definition to be insightful and thus will significantly support our analysis of CHWs in this paper.
index 0
data In Ghana, two complementary types of CHWs are notable. The first category are an informal, poorly trained health service-supporting CHWs. In this category, CHWs are informally a part of the health system, and the health authorities or collaborating development partner (non-governmental organisation, NGO) takes responsibility for their recruitment, training, incentives and/or remuneration. The second strand of CHWs exists where CHWs are representatives of the community and act in the interest of the community. CHWs under this category have no or limited affiliation with the formal healthcare system, and mainly spearhead community-driven preventive health activities. Despite this distinction, we admit that many CHWs might be combining both roles in practice. From our experiences and in our view, a ‘hybrid’ form of CHWs (a mix of the two categories) can be found in Ghana.
index 1
data Similar to the international trend, CHWs are diversely named in Ghana, including but not limited to names such as community health volunteers (CHVs), traditional birth attendants (TBAs), village health volunteers, community health champions, peer health educators, community child growth promoters, community nurses, community health committee members, community-based surveillance volunteers (CBSVs), community-based agents and lay health workers.16
19
20
23–26 These different characterisations generally reflect the diverse and ambiguous identities of CHWs in the international health literature and in health policy programmatic interventions.10
21
27–29 For the purpose of clarity, we refer to CHWs in this paper as any of the above category of health workforce who, though not formal employees of the health system in Ghana, are either a health service-supporting CHW or community representatives, who have been identified, trained or untrained, and assigned roles in the community for which they receive no or some form of formal remuneration.
index 2
data Historically, CHWs such as TBAs have operated in most Ghanaian communities.30 However, attempts to formally organise and recognise them came after the Alma-Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care (PHC). Village health workers (VHWs) provided the first semblance of CHWs in Ghana. These were local community representatives whose actions and activities were mostly based on altruism. Although their roles such as community mobilisation, health awareness creation and immunisation campaigns were critical to the modest gains Ghana achieved from implementing the PHC strategy, their activities were short-lived such that by the 1980s, VHWs were no longer used. Lack of coordination and inadequate supervision of their activities were among the reasons why the VHWs programme was discontinued.
index 3
data As a result, community health nurses (CHNs) were introduced to deliver healthcare in mostly deprived parts of Ghana.24 Unlike the VHWs, CHNs were recruited, provided professional training in nursing training colleges, deployed into mostly rural parts of Ghana and formally remunerated to provide healthcare. However, the relatively long period needed to train them and funding challenges limited adequate training and deployment of CHNs. Consequently, the activities of VHWs were reinvigorated in the early 1990s. Central to their re-emergence was the Navrongo Experiment, a pilot project which culminated in the current Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) concept.24
26 Since then, CHWs have continued to evolve both in name and role. Currently, CBSVs form the majority of CHWs in Ghana. However, there is still lack of clarity on their contribution, recruitment, scope of practice and remuneration.
index 4
data Evidence of the success of a plethora of community health interventions supported and delivered by CHWs exists in the international health policy and systems research literature.12
13
27
31 Although CHWs are involved in many domains of healthcare delivery in Ghana, our review identified four important areas where CHWs' contributions have been immense. These four areas are examined in this paper.
index 5
data The Navrongo Experiment is one of the areas where CHWs' contributions to healthcare delivery have been acknowledged globally. The Navrongo Community Health and Family Planning Project, popularly referred to as the Navrongo Experiment, which culminated in the birth of the current CHPS programme in Ghana, sought to improve access to healthcare in deprived communities using mostly community-driven resources and structures. The intervention was conceptualised under the assumption that by recruiting, training and deploying community health officers to rural communities, inequities in access to healthcare services between urban and rural settings could be bridged. Under the Navrongo Experiment, CHWs played several critical roles, including outreach services, community mobilisation for health educational talks and referral to health facilities.32
33
index 6
data The Navrongo Experiment resulted in increased access to healthcare services, immunisation coverage, reduced child and maternal mortality while improving the rural population's overall health. For example, within a period of 3 years of its implementation, the results pointed to a 50% reduction in childhood mortality rate and 15% reduction in fertility rate.24 Given this landmark success, results from this experimental intervention led to the conceptualisation and implementation of the CHPS programme as the country's main policy enactment aimed at improving access to health services in rural Ghana. Owing to its overall success, Ghana's CHPS programme has been acclaimed as among the most successful community-based health programmes globally.32–35
index 7
data Without the diverse contributions of CBSVs, Ghana's current success in eradicating the guinea worm (Dracunculiasis) would have been unlikely. Ghana was ranked second globally in 2006 among the guinea worm endemic countries.36
37 Currently, however, Ghana is guinea worm free. Studies and reports from the Ghana Health Service and non-state actors (NGOs) have underscored the critical roles played by CHWs in eradicating the guinea worm in Ghana.38–41 Their roles included community mobilisation for awareness raising campaigns on the spread of the guinea worm, administration of palliative care, door-to-door distribution of drugs, referral to health centres for treatment, and distribution of water filters in communities.38
39
42
43 Indeed, their role was so critical that both the National Guinea Worm Eradication Programme and some development partners (eg, Carter Center) have acknowledged it as being the most important factor in Ghana's guinea worm eradication campaign.44
index 8
data Globally, CHWs have been acclaimed as having played a tremendous role in decreasing childhood illnesses and mortalities.13
45
46 Notably, case management of childhood illness is one area where their contribution has been highly commended by the WHO and UNICEF.47 A study in Ghana reported that CHWs were instrumental in establishing community health post, making home visits to provide healthcare services such as administration of antibiotics, oral rehydration solution and zinc to treat childhood illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria.48 Similar results have been reported by other studies globally.20
23
24
49
50 Again in Ghana, the role of TBAs has been reported to double the number of women referred to clinics and hospitals for potentially life-saving care and support.51 Indeed, in several communities in Bolgatanga, Kassena Nankana and Bawku West districts of Ghana, Oxfam has trained and evaluated the work of some 150 TBAs.30
51 The evidence from Oxfam's work has shown positive results. In each of the communities where Oxfam trained and worked with TBAs, the number of women being referred by TBAs to clinics and hospitals for potentially life-saving care doubled.51 Maternal mortality has similarly reduced by 7%.51
index 9
data Further, between 2005 and 2007, one of the authors (JKG) was involved in a community-based pilot health project in 30 communities in Nadowli District, Upper West Region, Ghana.30 This project was implemented by World Vision Ghana in partnership with Ghana Health Services. The project trained CBSVs and TBAs to perform a number of tasks, including recording births and deaths, and reporting disease outbreaks.30 Several TBAs also got trained to detect danger signs during pregnancy and labour and to make quick referral of pregnant women to health facilities to receive skilled care.30 The TBAs were all provided basic consumables such as hand gloves, hand sanitisers, new packs of cutting blades and kerosene lanterns (to be used in the night when there is no electricity). The main aim of the project was to improve TBAs' skills and resource them adequately to conduct normal deliveries, particularly in hard-to-reach rural communities. In mid-2007, an initial evaluation was done. The evaluation results showed that antenatal care attendance in some communities had increased twofold (ie, 41% in 2005 to 85% in 2007).30 Qualitative interviews with women and TBAs suggested that many TBAs who received the training and essential consumables actively encouraged and referred pregnant women to healthcare facilities.30 Also, among women who delivered at home with TBAs, infections resulting from the use of bare hands and other unhygienic practices by TBAs (such as the same blade being used to sever the umbilical cords of two babies) during labour were reported to have reduced. The women and TBAs who participated in the interviews largely attributed the increase in the number of referrals to health facilities for skilled delivery and a reduction in infections during labour to the training TBAs received and the supply of hand gloves, hand sanitisers and new blades.30 In fact, these positive results from Ghana are supported by evidence from other low income contexts.52–56 Notwithstanding these evidences, TBAs' activities in maternal healthcare until now are still surrounded with controversies because the WHO official position only permits TBAs to make referrals and not conduct home deliveries.30
51 However, based on this evidence from the Upper East Region and the fact that in Ghana only 55% of births are attended to by a skilled attendant (defined here as a doctor, nurse or midwife), and 30% by TBAs,30 we consider the WHO position on TBAs as untenable in LMICs such as Ghana where the capacity to provide skilled and supervised delivery is limited.

data In other parts of the world especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the role of CHWs has been important in the fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS.5
57–60 In Ghana, the literature suggests that CHWs were recognised as a conduit to providing voluntary counselling and testing services. A cross-sectional survey conducted in northern Ghana reported an overwhelming acceptance (98.7%) of the use of lay health counsellors to provide community-based voluntary counselling and testing services.19 We noted, however, that only a few studies have covered the activities of CHWs in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in communities. Our experience in working at the community level in Ghana shows that CHWs are a key cadre of health staff working closely with CHOs and NGOs in raising HIV/AIDS awareness, mobilising communities against stigma and discrimination and providing a culturally acceptable or a community-competent context for people living with HIV/AIDS. Despite this, the District Health Information Management System (DHIMS), a comprehensive database which reports on all aspects of services delivered by the Ghana Health Service, does not report on CHWs’ contribution to HIV/AIDS prevention and management. This suggests that even in contexts where their contribution is not in doubt, the healthcare system has not adequately documented or recognised their role.
index 11
data Prior to the inception of the One Million CHW Campaign (to which we return later), there was no national framework to guide the recruitment of CHWs in Ghana. As a result, their recruitment was dependent on the community, the health programme, and the donor agency or development partner (NGO) involved. From the international literature48
50 and our experiences in Ghana as well, CHWs are generally recruited from their own communities based on their level of acceptability in their respective communities, previous involvement in community-driven initiatives, high sense of dedication to duty and literacy (education) level. Although these considerations are important, they are no doubt subjective and may affect the objective assessment and recruitment of CHWs. Our experience in some communities shows that the lack of clearly defined recruitment criteria and strategy has often generated tensions among community members. Indeed, some earlier studies have indicated how recruiting CHWs from local communities often served to generate tension and/or perpetuate gender inequalities.61
index 12
data An important dimension regarding the recruitment of CHWs in Ghana is the active role of NGOs and other non-state actors. Many NGOs and other non-state actors who operate and/or implement parallel or vertical healthcare programmes in Ghana often recruit parallel CHWs. In most cases, this parallel recruitment is often without regard for existing structures. From our experience, the NGOs’ style of engagement with CHWs can be problematic because recruiting CHWs without recourse to already existing structures can breed conflicts, duplication of efforts, lack of community participation and ownership of a particular health intervention and redundancies following the completion of the programmes of such organisations.
index 13
data Comparable to the global situation, the scope of practice for CHWs lacks clarity and remains undefined in Ghana. There has been a long-standing debate as to what exactly their roles should be and to what extent they are supposed to act in providing healthcare.21
62 According to a report by UNICEF, in South Asia, one CHW can provide healthcare services to about 10 to 1000 households.63 Generally, CHWs tend to provide more preventive and promotive healthcare, rather than curative.11
27 In other settings, the roles of CHWs have been observed to vary from community mobilisation for immunisation campaigns, health talks, first aid, creating awareness on disease control and health promotion to activities such as registration of births and deaths.12
21
27
64
index 14
data In Ghana, owing to the acute shortage of health personnel, CHWs' scope of practice has broadened beyond prevention and health promotional activities to encompass some curative care such as treatment for malaria and diarrhoea. Generally, the scope of practice of CHWs in Ghana varies widely, including serving as aids to community health officers, home visits, disease surveillance, maintaining environmental sanitation, nutrition education, home management of minor ailments like uncomplicated malaria, social mobilisation, and providing a limited range of reproductive and child health services.38
65 While this varied and flexible scope of practice may be a unique strength, it is therefore to be inferred that the lack of clarity on the operational mandates of CHWs in Ghana has often undermined the effectiveness and efficiency of their roles in healthcare delivery at the community level. As observed by some researchers, a reasonable involvement of CHWs in limited activities has the tendency to enhance outcomes in community-based health interventions compared with an unlimited scope of practice.31
index 15
data Remuneration of CHWs is a controversial subject that has eluded consensus among stakeholders.38
66 Internationally, the discourse is suggestive of the need to compensate their services in the form of a fee or in kind by the beneficiary communities. Some other non-monetary incentives such as providing bicycles, certificates or free healthcare to CHWs are also common.31
67
68 As a result, the WHO has underscored the need to pay CHWs reasonable wages in order to enhance their productivity, sustain community-driven interventions and reduce their attrition rates.69–71 The available literature has copiously cited the positive correlation between incentivising CHWs and lower rates of attrition.13
21
57
72
index 16
data In Ghana, CHWs are not remunerated by governments,48 and a spirit of volunteerism and altruism is rather emphasised. CHWs are required to draw satisfaction from community recognition, ability to gain skills and experience and the opportunity it presents to them to build social capital and access other job opportunities. This contradicts the WHO position and existing literature, which recommend the remuneration of CHWs.73
74 For instance, in the work of Lehmann and Sanders,21 the non-payment of CHWs under the premise that they were volunteers and offered services based on altruistic motives failed to motivate the CHWs to support the sustainability of community-based health interventions. Our experience suggests that contrary to the government's view that CHWs activities should be inspired by altruism, CHWs usually have high expectations of rewards in the form of regular wages, stipends and some form of career opportunities to eventuate them into the health system.
index 17
data While CHWs are gaining increasing attention as important players in healthcare delivery in Ghana and elsewhere, they are beset with multiple challenges. CHWs face capacity problems as they receive little or no formal training. One author noted this as a fundamental concern among CHWs as most of the experience they require for their job are gathered on the job.4 Quite notably, the Ghana Health Service recently attempted to address this challenge by developing training guides for some categories of CHWs.65 However, from our experience, there has been limited uptake of these training guides. We have also observed the inadequate supply of basic equipment such as wellington booths, bicycles, hand gloves and the first aid kit that some CHWs use to facilitate their work.
index 18
data Neglect or inadequate recognition of CHWs is another fundamental challenge. As noted earlier, the absence of a policy directive on CHWs lends credence to our position. The current policy position of the government, which does not remunerate CHWs for contributing to deliver community health service, only exacerbates the dwindling enthusiasm of CHWs and the time they commit to their duties. This, to a large extent, affects negatively their productivity and retention. Further, this has the potential to increase their attrition rates as has been reported in other settings to vary between 3.2% and 77%.13
50
75 Also, the attendant long-run effect of this situation is the high costs involved in selecting and training new CHWs as replacements.
index 19
data The inadequate recognition of CHWs has further led to the lack of a framework to regulate their practices as evidenced in the varying roles CHWs assume as espoused in earlier sections of this paper. The situation creates an inherent ambiguity and varying expectations of their roles which affects the optimum engagement of CHWs. In Ghana, there are neither mechanisms nor a framework to regulate their practice or certify CHWs as having the requisite competencies to practice as in the case of other health professionals such as medical doctors, nurses or CHNs. To be able to attain standardisation and integration of the services of CHWs into the health system, a form of oversight is required. This may take the form of a regulatory or professional body which will provide some form of certification or licensing to duly recognise their competencies and standardise their practices.
index 20
data Lack of effective supervision of CHWs is one of the notable problems CHWs face in Ghana. Our experiences in northern Ghana suggest that laxity in the supervision of CHWs is mainly due to the already overstretched nature of the health system, which is attributable in part to the human resources for health crises. Given that CHWs are now taking up more curative care activities in addition to the preventive-based care interventions, their activities should be supervised and coordinated closely to potentially optimise their productivity and improve health outcomes as evident in studies from other settings.64
76
77
index 21
data Also, a further step by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to scale up the number of frontline staff to provide healthcare to the rural communities is the current partnership with the One Million CHW Campaign project to introduce a new cadre of CHWs in Ghana. This represents an important health policy direction in improving access and health outcomes of the rural populace in Ghana. The One Million CHW Campaign proposed to introduce a world-class cadre of CHWs to extend essential health services to household levels functioning as an integral component of the community health system.78 Conceptually and based on the literature on CHWs, this category of CHWs will be an informal extension of the formal healthcare system with explicitly defined roles, training and remuneration to augment the delivery of healthcare. Notably, this new cadre of CHWs differs substantially from the CHWs who are the subject of this paper except in their duties. While the policy issues of existing CHWs still remain to be addressed, the new programme only proposes to recognise the existing CHWs provided they will be useful in providing voluntary assistance to the formally remunerated new cadre of CHWs, and their continuous existence will be dependent on the particular health district. A justifiable policy question may therefore be why introduce a new cadre of CHWs to take up duties which were essentially carried out by a particular workforce but whose contribution has hitherto not been recognised and whose integration into the new programme has not been explicitly addressed. If such concerns are not addressed, there will most likely be challenges such as conflicting roles, tension between CHWs of the One Million CHW Campaign and existing CHWs, lack of community participation and a threat to the sustainability of community-based health interventions.
index 22
data The preceding analysis points to a general policy deficit regarding CHWs in Ghana, given the lack of a national framework to guide activities of CHWs such as recruitment, credentialling, scope of practice, remuneration, career development, performance management, supervisory mechanisms, integration into the formal health system, capacity development and logistical requirement and deployment. Despite the active involvement of CHWs in the health system, they are invisible nationally and subnationally in terms of policies, strategies and budgeting.78 We therefore recommend the following immediate and long-term measures to forestall anticipated and existing challenges faced by CHWs:
The establishment or enactment of a national policy on CHWs which should define and outline the relevant aspects of their recruitment, credentialling, scope of practice, remuneration, career development, performance management, supervisory mechanisms, integration into the formal health system, capacity development and logistical requirement and deployment.The establishment of a professional and/or regulatory body that will exercise oversight over CHWs by defining, monitoring or enforcing the standards and practice of CHWs in Ghana including licensing or a form of certification.The development of a long-term strategy that will see the gradual replacement or absorption of CHWs into the mainstream or formal health service in Ghana.That the proposed One Million CHW Campaign project should incorporate an integration plan aimed at enlisting existing deserving CHWs who have a wealth of experience and skill to their credit and to further develop the capacities of those with inadequate skills to enable them to enlist and participate in the programme.Finally, policy steps should be taken to critically review the WHO position on TBAs’ roles in promoting maternal health. Given the shortage of skilled birth attendants (SBAs) in Ghana and across sub-Saharan Africa as indicated by the latest WHO report on the ‘state of the world’s midwifery’,79 it is clear that the ideal of ensuring skilled attendance at all births is not feasible or achievable in the short term. Therefore, reasonably acceptable equity and efficiency arguments can be made for the building of working partnerships with and incorporation of TBAs into the maternal healthcare system in contexts such as Ghana where skilled maternal healthcare provision is acutely limited.30 Indeed, widespread collaboration through policy support for the healthcare system to identify, train and enhance the skill sets of TBAs is recommended. Partnerships between TBAs and SBAs would also be critical for helping healthcare workers to learn from TBAs how best to address the cultural needs and concerns of childbearing women.30 Thus, even if the Ghanaian health system were to train and deploy sufficient numbers of SBAs to all parts of the country in the future, TBAs could still play important roles in helping healthcare workers to provide culturally competent care.30
index 23
data This relatively modest contribution by CHWs to healthcare delivery in Ghana suggests the need for state and non-state actors alike to build better working partnerships with CHWs, provide financial remuneration, create career opportunities and other means of motivations to boost their productivity and sustain gains associated with their activities. In addition, there is the need for policy definition to harmonise the issues relating to CHWs in general. This is because CHWs play an indispensable role in delivering health to their communities and assume and actively play the role of health activists and advocates. The reported challenges faced by CHWs can be addressed through appropriate national policy articulation, and therefore development partners should work in partnership with the government of Ghana to put in place these policies.

data Recent years evidence an exponential increase in the number of papers on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), indicating that the phenomenon of protein intrinsic disorder is becoming a popular research topic. This point is also reflected in the articles of the “Digested Disorder” series published in this journal.1-3 To make this point stronger some interesting numbers are provided below. PubMed search (as of August 03, 2014) for ((intrinsically disordered) OR (natively unfolded) OR (intrinsically unstructured) OR (intrinsically unfolded) OR (intrinsically flexible protein)) returned 2,490 hits. Restricting this search to the past one and a half years only (i.e., searching for ((intrinsically disordered) OR (natively unfolded) OR (intrinsically unstructured) OR (intrinsically unfolded) OR (intrinsically flexible protein)) AND (“2013/01/01”[Date - Publication]: “3000”[Date - Publication])) gives 659 hits. Curiously, although papers on IDPs (2,490) constitute just 0.045% of all the protein-related papers (5,569,481) published during the past 115 years, the fraction of IDP-related papers increases to 0.18% if only publications of the past year and a half are taken into account. It is of interest to compare these trends with the related tendencies of the research on proteins in general. Protein-related papers (5,569,481) constitute ∼23% of all the papers published during the past 115 y and annotated in PubMed (24,068,783). However, this number decreases to ∼21% if only papers published during the past year and a half are taken into account (in 2013–2014, the overall number of published papers is 1,719,568; the number of papers dealing with proteins is 362,612). This suggests that an IDP is a new rising star in the field of protein science.

data Despite this steady and sure increase in the appreciation of protein intrinsic disorder, there are still numerous instances when this concept is overlooked, or missed or simply ignored. Unfortunately, such “missed disorder” phenomenon continues to be rather common in the modern literature. The original goal of the first article in the new “Unreported disorder in proteins” series was to find several papers published in different journals that talk about IDPs (or hybrid proteins containing both ordered and disordered regions) not recognizing that they are talking about such proteins, to show how consideration of intrinsic disorder can be used to strengthen conclusions and draw relationships to prior discoveries in the field. However, analysis of recent publications in just 2 journals revealed that the “missed disorder” happened to be essentially more abundant than it was originally expected. In fact, as of August 3, 2014, of 677 papers published during 2013–2014 in the Journal of Molecular Biology, 609 were dealing with proteins, with 87 papers being dedicated to the IDPs or hybrid proteins. Papers were considered to be dealing with intrinsic disorder if their texts contained at least a single mention of disorder, flexibility, conformational flexibility, or unfoldedness in relation to the protein of interest or any of its regions. Obviously, this is a very relaxed and inclusive approach, since simple mentioning of disorder or conformational flexibility is not sufficient for the detailed elucidation of the functional role of disorder/flexibility. The direct PubMed search for the IDP-related papers published in the Journal of Molecular Biology using the search criteria ((intrinsic disorder) OR (intrinsically disordered) OR (natively unfolded) OR (intrinsically unstructured) OR (intrinsically unfolded) OR (intrinsically flexible protein)) AND (“2013/01/01”[Date - Publication]: “3000”[Date - Publication]) AND (“Journal of Molecular Biology”[Journal]) generated just 17 hits. Analysis of the table of content of this journal combined with a brief computational analysis of related proteins revealed that there are at least 22 more papers, research subject of which are IDPs. Analogous analysis of the publications in Biochemistry during the 2013–2014 provided comparable data: of 1455 published papers, 25 were “officially” dedicated to intrinsic disorder or to intrinsically disordered/natively unfolded/intrinsically unstructured/intrinsically unfolded/intrinsically flexible proteins. Mining of papers published in Biochemistry during 2013–2014 revealed that some 189 papers contained at least a single mention of “conformational flexibility” OR “intrinsic disorder” OR “disordered protein” OR “disordered peptide” OR “disordered region” OR “natively unfolded” in relation to the protein of interest or any of its regions. Furthermore, based on the combination of literature mining and a brief computational analysis 20 “hidden gems” were found; i.e., papers that missed protein disorder.
index 1
data The mentioned 42 papers dealing with the unreported intrinsic disorder and their related IDPs or hybrid proteins containing ordered and intrinsically disordered regions are briefly outlined below. Table 1 contains all the proteins considered in this review. Proteins are arranged according to the increase in the extent of their disorder evaluated as percentage of the residues predicted to be disordered (i.e., possessing disorder scores above 0.5) by PONDR® VSL2, which is among the more accurate disorder predictors.4
Table 1 shows that the extent of unreported intrinsic disorder in 143 proteins ranges from 10% to 100%, indicating that all these proteins belong to the category of moderately or highly disordered proteins; i.e., proteins with the disorder content ranging from 10% to 30% and from 30% to 100%, respectively. Table 1 also shows that a very significant fraction of such proteins with overlooked disorder (>75%) belongs to the “highly disordered” category.

data The order of sections in this review crudely follows the order of proteins in Table 1. When several proteins are discussed in a paper, the corresponding section within the text is placed at a position ascribed by Table 1 to a protein with the lowest disorder content. The corresponding sections are organized in the following way: first, a brief description of the paper is provided; then, the biological importance of the related proteins is discussed; next, the results of the computational and bioinformatics analyses of the disorder status of a given protein (or set of proteins) are represented to show how consideration of intrinsic disorder can enhance conclusions of a paper.

data Andreou & Klostermeier investigated the peculiarities of the combined action of 3 eukaryotic translation initiation factors, eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4G, in RNA unwinding needed to resolve secondary structure elements from the 5′-untranslated region of mRNAs to enable ribosome scanning.5
index 4
data A set of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) is involved in the complex, multi-stage process of initiation of mRNA translation in eukaryotes. In the first step of this process, the eIF4F complex binds to the m7Gppp cap on the 5′-end of the mRNA. This eIF4F complex consists of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the scaffolding protein eIF4G, and the DEAD-box helicase eIF4A.6,7 At the next steps of the translation initiation, the eIF4F complex recruits the 43S ribosomal pre-initiation complex which scans the 5′-untranslated region in 5′-to-3′ direction in search for the translation start codon.8,9 One of the important points in this process is the resolution of secondary and tertiary structures in the mRNA, which is typically done by the DEAD-box helicase eIF4A, which possesses RNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activities.10 These 2 activities of eIF4A are enhanced by some auxiliary proteins, such as eIF4B and eIF4G that act synergistically stimulating the eIF4A helicase activity in the mRNA scanning process.5
index 5
data Figure 1 illustrates the disorder propensities of the 3 proteins related to the mRNA unwinding. Disorder was evaluated by a family of PONDR predictors. Here, scores above 0.5 correspond to disordered residues/regions. PONDR® VSL2B is one of the most accurate stand-alone disorder predictors,11 PONDR® VL3 possesses high accuracy in finding long IDPRs,12 PONDR® VLXT is not the most accurate predictor but has high sensitivity to local sequence peculiarities which are often associated with disorder-based interaction sites,13 whereas PONDR-FIT represents a metapredictor which, being moderately more accurate than each of the component predictors, is one of the most accurate disorder predictors.14 The various predictors often give different predictions of disorder for the same protein, perhaps leading so some confusion when trying to understand the implications of this and the following figures. These differences arise because of different computational methods and especially because different training sets were used. Despite the differences, the overall disorder prediction trends are typically similar for each protein.


index 6
data In agreement with the notion that catalytic functions require specific and ordered structure, eIF4A, with its ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activities, is predicted to be mostly ordered protein (see Fig. 1A; UniProt ID: P10081). The mostly ordered nature of this enzyme is further supported by the fact that almost entire sequence is seen in the crystal structure (see red structure at Fig. 1B, PDB ID: 2VSO), except to the residues 1–11, 126–135, 351–356, and 394–395. On the contrary, the auxiliary proteins eIF4B and eIF4G are predicted to possess long disordered regions (see Figs. 1C and 1D; UniProt IDs: P34167 and P39935, respectively). eIF4G is also predicted to have an ordered region that coincides with its middle or eIF4A interacting domain (residues 571–854). This region was co-crystallized with the eIF4A factor (see blue structure at Fig. 1B). Curiously, several eIF4G regions were missing in structure of the eIF4A-eIF4G complex (e.g., residues 571–576, 583–596, 686–688, 717–729, 803–811, and 853–854).
index 7
data Long intrinsically disordered regions are important for functions of eIF4B and eIF4G. In fact, according to ANCHOR,15,16 eIF4B (UniProt ID: P34167) is expected to have 14 disorder-based binding sites (residues 13–20, 33–40, 48–53, 68–74, 103–109, 159–166, 214–219, 234–244, 259–271, 286–298, 312–324, 338–355, 376–386, and 407–426). Similarly, eIF4G (UniProt ID: P39935) is predicted to have 18 AiBSs, residues 5–24, 32–53, 59–120, 130–158, 198–226, 230–241, 292–307, 329–342, 351–398, 411–433, 450–465, 474–485, 505–515, 570–583, 818–827, 832–844, 893–920, and 933–949.

data Florova et al. investigated the mechanisms of the stabilization of human plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1, also known as serpin E1) during the formation of the transient ternary “molecular sandwich” complex (MSC) containing PAI-1, vitronectin (Vn), and the target enzyme.17 Major players involved in the formation of this complex are PAI-1, which is a major endogenous inhibitor of plasminogen activators, a cell adhesive glycoprotein Vn, and a proteinase inhibited by PAI-1. An important feature of PAI-1 is its ability to exist in 2 forms, a metastable active conformation with solvent-accessible reactive center loop (RCL) and thermodynamically stable, inactive, latent conformation, where RCL is spontaneously inserted to the middle of the β-sheet B of PAI-1.17 This “magic” chameleon-like RCL is located in the 331–350 region. Figure 2A shows that although human PAI-1 (UniProt ID: P05121) is predicted to be mostly ordered, its RCL is located within grayish area with a mean disorder score close to 0.5, suggesting that this region is characterized by noticeable intrinsic mobility.


index 9
data Perumal et al. reported that a specific interaction between the bacteriophage T4 UvsW helicase and the T4 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein gp32 is required for enhancement of the UvsW DNA unwinding function.18 Curiously, UvsW interact with gp32, both in the presence and absence of DNA, through the C-terminal acidic tail of the gp32 protein. In the absence of this interaction, the ssDNA annealing and ATP-dependent translocation activities of UvsW are severely inhibited when gp32 coats the ssDNA lattice. However, when UvsW and gp32 do interact, UvsW is able to efficiently displace the gp32 protein from the ssDNA. The tail-less gp32 inhibits activities of UvsW on DNA in the presence of gp32.18
index 10
data The UvsW helicase, a member of the SF2 superfamily of helicases19 (i.e., enzymes that use ATP to carry out mechanical work related to the unwinding of duplex DNA structures and reorganization of RNA secondary structures20), is one of the 3 helicases encoded by the bacteriophage T4,21 where it plays a number of roles in a variety of DNA repair and recombination pathways.22-27 The involvement of this helicase in DNA replication is achieved via the UvsW-mediated unwinding of R-loop structures generated at the replication origin by the host RNA polymerase.22 UvsW (UniProt ID: P20703) activity involves the generation and consumption of single stranded DNA (ssDNA). In agreement with the overall low disorder predisposition (see Fig. 3A), almost entire sequence of UvsW was successfully crystallized (Fig. 3B, PDB ID: 2OCA).


index 11
data Naked ssDNA rarely occurs within T4-infected cells as they are immediately coated with gp32 ssDNA binding protein, which serves to protect it against degradation by endonucleases. The gp32 is also thought to coordinate the many activities necessary to carry out DNA replication, recombination and repair by recruiting and modulating the activity of the enzymes involved in these processes.28 The bacteriophage T4 gp32 (UniProt ID: P03695) is a 301 residue-long protein. The crystal structure of the gp32 central region (residues 22–239) is known (see Fig. 3C).29 Gp32 binds preferentially to ssDNA and destabilizes double-stranded DNA. It is involved in DNA replication, repair and recombination, dinds ssDNA as the replication fork advances and stimulates the replisome processivity and accuracy. The N-terminal region of gp32 is important for the cooperative binding of gp32 monomers on ssDNA, whereas the C-terminal acidic tail is involved interaction with the replicative DNA polymerase, the primase and helicase loader protein.30-32 Also, this C-terminal region (residues 254–301) was shown to play a crucial role in controlling the D-loop unwinding capability of UvsW, since the presence of a mutant gp32 protein lacking the acidic tail (delta254–301, gp32-A) led to a significant reduction in the unwinding of the D-loop substrate.18
Fig. 3D shows that a significant portion of the C-terminal half of this protein is predicted to be mostly disordered (residues 200–301). Curiously, this disordered region includes the functionally important C-terminal tail that defines the ability of gp32 to modulate the UvsW activity.

data Some bacteria and archaea contain specific cell envelope-spanning biomolecular machines, Type IV pili (T4P), which are used by bacteria and archaea to interact with the environment. Pilus biogenesis is controlled by the assembly of the outer membrane PilQ secretin channel through which the pili are extruded. Koo et al. investigated the roles of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IV pili (T4P) pilotin protein PilF in the outer membrane PilQ secretin channel targeting, oligomerization, and function.33
index 13
data PilF belongs to the class 1 pilotins, which are α-helical proteins containing several tetratricopeptide (TPR) motifs, that are comprised of approximately 34-amino acid and are able to form a superhelical fold that mediates protein–protein interactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.33 Secretins (including PilQ sectretin) possess a conserved C-terminal region, containing the secretin domain that is putatively embedded into the outer membrane, and a variable, system-specific N-terminal region.34,35
Figure 4A shows that the P.aeruginosa PilF (UniProt ID: Q51385) is predicted to be a hybrid protein possessing both ordered and disordered regions. Curiously, about 2/3 of this protein possesses disorder scores close to 0.5. This grayish area is likely to be characterized by high conformational plasticity and is predicted to contain 4 AiBSs, residues 5–16, 41–46, 76–81 and 111–115. Similarly, PilQ (UniProt ID: P34750) is predicted to be a hybrid protein (see Fig. 4B) with several disorder-based binding sites (residues 101–107, 120–122, 245–251, 502–505, and 533–547).


index 14
data Bonet et al. analyzed the molecular mechanisms of interaction of the 14–3–3ζ protein with several integrin proteins.36 The authors provided a detailed biophysical characterization of the cytoplasmic tails of α4, β1, β2 and β3 integrins binding to 14–3–3ζ and showed that binding affinities and interaction modes of different integrins with this 14–3–3 are rather different. Furthermore, although many structural features of these interactions are similar to other known 14–3–3 complexes, the binding exhibits specific features involving secondary sites. Particularly, in addition to a canonical binding mode for the α4 phospho-peptide, some residues outside the consensus 14–3–3ζ binding motif of this integrin were shown to be essential for an efficient interaction. Although a short β2 phospho-peptide is sufficient for high-affinity binding to 14–3–3ζ, the authors also found novel 14–3–3ζ/integrin tail interactions that were independent of phosphorylation. 36
index 15
data The members of the 14–3–3 family are highly conserved acidic proteins of ∼30 kDa that are abundantly expressed in all eukaryotic cells. In human, there are 7 14–3–3 isoforms (β, γ, ε, η, σ, τ and ζ) forming homodimers or heterodimers. These proteins regulate and control many signaling pathways, such as cytoskeletal dynamics programmed cell death, and cell cycle progression, and are involved in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders.37,38 Although 14–3–3 proteins are considered as phosphor-serine/threonine binding modules possessing 2 consensus recognition motifs, RSXpSXP and RXF/YXpSXP,39 some other binding modes are known including interaction with some unphosphorylated motifs.40,41 X-ray structures of various 14–3–3 isoforms and their numerous complexes are known providing considerable knowledge on the various binding modes.42,43 Curiously, a detailed analysis of more than 200 binding partners of 14–3–3 proteins showed neither structural nor functional relatedness in this group of proteins.44 However, bioinformatics analysis established that >90 % of the 14–3–3 interactors contain disordered regions and that almost all 14–3–3-binding sites are located inside disordered regions.44
index 16
data Among various partners of 14–3–3 proteins are membrane-spanning receptors, integrins, which are involved in numerous biological functions, such as cell adhesion, migration and differentiation and are associated with a wide-range of diseases.45,46 Integrins are heterodimers formed by α- and β-subunits composed of large extracellular (ecto) domains, trans-membrane domains and short (13–70 residues) C-terminal cytoplasmic domains,47 which are flexible tails acting as hubs for numerous integrin-based protein-protein interactions.48-50 These cytoplasmic tails of the 2 integrin subunits also mediates the bidirectional inside-to-outside and outside-to-inside signaling, where signals transmitted by integrins from outside to inside the cell promote cell survival and proliferation, and where integrin affinity for the extracellular ligands can also be controlled by intracellular factors.47
index 17
data Figure 5A represents a structure of the complex between the 14–3–3ζ protein (blue cloud) and a phosphorylated peptide from the β2 integrin tail (red chain).51 It is seen that similar to many other 14–3–3 complexes, the β2 integrin tail is bound in a highly extended form. To illustrate interactivity of the β2 integrin, Figure 5B shows the results of the analysis of this protein by STRING. Here, settings were chosen to find binding partners with the highest confidence (0.9). Finally, Figure 3C shows some disorder-based alignments of the C-terminal tails used in the work of Bonet et al.,36 namely residues 1001–1032 of human integrin α4 (black line, UniProt ID P13612), residues 752–801 of human integrin β1 (black line, UniProt ID P05556), residues 724–769 of human integrin β2 (black line, UniProt ID P05107), residues 742–788 of human integrin β3 (black line, UniProt ID P05106), and residues 747–798 of human integrin β7 (black line, UniProt ID P26010). Figure 5C clearly shows that all these integrin tails involved in the specific interaction with the 14–3–3ζ protein are mostly disordered.

data In the review by Rajsbaum et al., an important family of proteins, tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins is introduced together with the multitude of their functional roles in the innate antiviral immunity.52 Since there are more than 70 distinct members in the family of human TRIM proteins, it is physically impossible to consider all of them even very superficially. The feature that links all these proteins together is the fact that they share 3 conserved N-terminal domains: a Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain, one or 2 B-Boxes (B1/B2) and a coiled-coil domain.53-56 In addition to immune-related functions many TRIM proteins are involved in a wide range of biological activities, such as transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, development, oncogenesis, ubiquitin E3 ligases, and E3 ligases for other ubiquitin-like molecules such as SUMO and the IFN-inducible protein ISG15.57 Computational analysis (see Table 1) revealed that all members of the human TRIM family are extensively disordered.

data Helbig and Beard overviewed the ability of viperin to modulate conditions within the cell and to interfere with proviral host proteins in order to create an unfavorable environment for viral replication.58 Viperin is one of the few products of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) possessing direct antiviral activity, being able to limit a broad range of viruses and to play an emerging role in modulating innate immune signaling. This is a highly species conserved protein consisting of 3 distinct domains: a variable N-terminal domain that contains an amphipathic helix and a leucine zipper region, a highly conserved central domain containing a “radical SAM domain,” and a conserved C-terminal critical for the antiviral properties of viperin against a number of viruses.58 The authors showed that viperin plays a role in innate immune signaling, limits different viruses through both direct inhibition of replication and interference with viral budding/release, and disrupts the actin cytoskeleton to increase infectivity of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in a known example of evolutionary escape of HCMV from the antiviral properties of viperin.58 Viperin is able to interact with the 5 host proteins FPPS, TFP, IRAK1, VAP-A and TRAF6 and the 3 viral proteins DENV NS3, HCV NS5A and HCMV vMIA in order to accomplish these diverse biological functions.58
Figure 6A represents the results of the STRING59-based evaluation of viperin interactivity. Although it has been emphasized that “It is unusual for viperin to be able to interact with such a divergent range of other proteins and to potentially mediate quite distinct cellular functions”,58 the mystery of such “unusual” polyfunctionality is naturally solved by the presence of extensive disorder in this protein (see Fig. 6B; UniProt ID: Q8WXG1).

data Sze et al. overviewed available information on the sterile α motif and histidine-aspartic domain (HD) containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), which is a member of the unique group of host restriction factors that limit retroviral replication at distinct stages of the viral life cycle.60 SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase responsible for the degradation of the deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) into their deoxynucleosides (dN) and inorganic triphosphates, thus depleting the cellular dNTP pool required for cellular DNA polymerase.61 Activity of this protein is modulated by post-translational modifications, cell-cycle-dependent functions and cytokine-mediated changes, as well as via interaction with the Vpx accessory protein.60
index 21
data SAMHD1is a predominantly nuclear protein composed of 2 functional domains, the sterile α motif (SAM) domain involved in protein–protein and SAMHD1-nucleic acid interactions,62 and the HD domain containing the enzymatic sites crucial for its triphosphohydrolase activity, RNA binding and nuclease activity.63 Another functionally important region is located at the C-terminus of SAMHD1, where a V-domain capable of interaction with the HIV-2/SIVsm Vpx accessory protein is located (residues 595–626).64 Based on the intrinsic disorder propensity analysis (Fig. 2B), SAMHD1 (UniProt ID: Q9Y3Z3) is expected to be a predominantly ordered protein possessing disordered N- and C-terminal tails (residues 1–100 and 580–626). Obviously, intrinsic disorder in the C-terminal tail is important for the SAMHD1 interaction with the HIV-2/SIVsm Vpx accessory protein.

data In their recent paper, Lenz & Ron described a novel interaction between the major heat shock chaperone GroESL of E. coli (Hsp60) with an RNA chaperone (CspC) leading to the CspC proteolysis needed for the transient nature of the heat shock response.65
index 23
data Protein chaperones and proteases have multiple functions in controlling the wellbeing of a cell, acting as protein quality control that enables the cells to cope with the unfolding and aggregation of proteins.66,67 CspC is a member of the cold shock protein (Csp) family that consists of 7 small homologues with high affinity to single-strand nucleic acid and that serve as RNA chaperones.68-71 It has been shown that CspC is degraded during heat shock and that interaction of CspC with the major protein chaperone GroESL plays a role in the enhanced, temperature-dependent proteolysis of CspC.65
index 24
data The fact that CspC is able to interact with GroESL (which is known to bind partially unfolded and misfolded protein species) is a clear indication that CspC does not possess rigid structure, at least under the conditions favoring such interaction. The likely explanation for this binding is in the potential intrinsically disordered nature of CspC. In fact, many protein and RNA chaperones were shown to be intrinsically disordered or hybrid proteins possessing both ordered and intrinsically disordered regions/domains.72 In agreement with this observation, Figure 2C represents the PONDR plots for the CspC from E. coli (UniProt ID: P0A9Y6) and shows that a significant portion of this small proteins (up to 35%) is predicted to be disordered.

data Kalli et al. used multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to define the interaction mechanisms of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN; UniProt ID: P60484) and of the PTEN domain of Ciona intestinalis voltage sensitive phosphatase (Ci-VSP; UniProt ID: Q4W8A1) with phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)-containing lipid bilayers.73 The authors revealed that the association of the PTEN with such bilayers involves the formation of an initial electrostatics-driven encounter complex between the protein and bilayer followed by reorientation of the protein to optimize its interactions with PIP molecules in the membrane.73 PTEN is a cytosolic enzyme that can interact with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and, being bound to membrane, catalyzes dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P3 to PtdIns(4,5)P2.74 PTEN has 4 domains, an N-terminal PIP2-binding module, a phosphatase domain (PD), a C2 domain, and a C-terminal tail. Several recent studies indicated that both N- and C-tails of this protein are intrinsically disordered.75-77 Furthermore, it has been emphasized that post-translational modifications, conserved eukaryotic linear motifs, and molecular recognition features are present in the disordered C-tail of PTEN, enhancing protein-protein interactions of this protein needed for the various cellular functions of PTEN.75

data Singh et al. determined the structure of Pukovnik Xis by X-ray crystallography.78 Xis is the recombination directionality factor that serves as a DNA bending machine that difines the outcome of integrase-mediated site-specific recombination by redesign of higher-order protein–DNA architectures.79 Mycobacterium phage Pukovnik (which is a relative of phage L5) contains a small Xis protein (56 residues) that binds cooperatively to attR DNA at specific X1–X4 binding sequences. Similar to L5, Pukovnik Xis stimulates integrase-mediated excision and inhibits integration.80,81 The presence of both Xis and intergrase is needed for the formation of an attR intasome.78 The cooperative binding of several Xis proteins to DNA is driven by a winged-helix motif and relies on the use of contacts between a central loop and the wing motif to mediate interactions between Xis proteins when bound to DNA leading to the formation of a micronucleoprotein filament with a modest bend.78,82,83
index 27
data Singh et al. showed that in the DNA-bound form, 5 individual Pukovnik Xis subunits stack onto each other through an extensive array of protein–protein interactions forming a filament with left-handed superhelical twist.78 Stacking of Xis subunits within the filament is rather regular, and each monomer exhibits a twist of 40° and an ∼60° bending angle. Within the asymmetric unit, the filament region contains 4 Xis protomers whereas the fifth protomer is positioned adjacent to the filament. This “outside” protomer forms the domain-swapped complex with the Xis protomer 3. This domain-swapped Xis pair is created due to a dramatic rearrangement within the loop connecting β1 and β2 (residues 36–39) allowing the C-terminal residues 40–56 of one subunit to interact with the N-terminal 35 residues of a neighboring Xis monomer.78 It has been emphasized that the most important protein-protein interactions mediating the filament formation are formed by residues 51–54 of Pukovnik Xis that make extensive contacts with the wing of the adjacent monomer and deletion of which greatly diminishes DNA binding affinity and abolishes excision.78 Therefore, although the Xis filament is composed of identical subunits, the individual Xis protomers are involved in very different interactions and form very different interfaces. To further illustrate this point, Figure 7A represents a crystal structure of the Pukovnik Xis pentamer (PDB ID: 4J2N) and 4 pairs of different dimers found within this pentameric filament. Figure 7B shows that Pukovnik Xis (UniProt ID: B3VGI6) is predicted to contain substantial amount of intrinsic disorder (note scale of the Y-axis), including disordered N- and C-terminal tails. Therefore, it is likely that the intrinsically disordered nature determines the ability of this small protein to be involved in a complex net of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, including its ability to form a wide array of regular and domain-swapped dimers.

data Li et al. provided a detailed characterization of the functional mechanisms of interesting Hsp90 co-chaperones, human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) interacting protein (AIP) and AIP like 1 (AIPL1).84 AIP and AIPL1 share 49% sequence identity, contain an N-terminal FKBP-like prolyl peptidyl isomerase (PPIase) domain (which is inactive in both proteins) followed by a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. In addition, AIPL1 harbors a unique C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD).84 The authors showed that AIP is inactive as a chaperone, whereas AIPL1 exhibits chaperone activity and prevents the aggregation of non-native proteins, suggesting that PRD is crucial for the chaperone function of this protein providing a means for efficient binding of AIPL1 to non-native proteins.84 Since AIPL1 possesses decreased affinity to Hsp90, the C-terminal PRD plays a role of a negative regulator of the AIPL1-Hsp90 interaction.84
index 29
data Figure 8A shows that the major portion of the human AIPL1 (N-terminal 75%) containing FKBP-like prolyl peptidyl isomerase and TPR domains is predicted to be mostly ordered (UniProt ID: Q9NZN9), whereas the C-terminal domain is predicted to be highly disordered. On the other hand, Figure 8B indicates that the human AIP (UniProt ID: O00170) is expected to be mostly ordered. In agreement with these disorder predictions, 3D structures are known for the PPIase FKBP-type domain of human AIP (residues 2–166, PDB ID: 2LKN) and for its TPR domain (residues 173–330, PDB ID: 4AIF). The intrinsically disordered nature of the C-terminal PRD of the human AIPL1 possessing chaperone activity is in accord with earlier observations that chaperones are often either entirely disordered or contain long disordered regions.72,85

data Takeyama et al. provided a detailed description of the interaction between the activated protein C (APC) and factor (F) VIIIa.86 The authors showed that the basic residues located within the 39-, 60-, and 70–80-loops of APC constitutes an exosite that contributes to the binding of FVIII and therefore are important for the subsequent proteolytic inactivation of FVIII.86 APC, which is also known as vitamin K-dependent protein C, anticoagulant protein C, autoprothrombin IIA, and blood coagulation factor XIV, is a single chain vitamin K-dependent zymogen for a plasma serine protease that upon activation by the thrombin–thrombomodulin complex down regulates the coagulation cascade by limited proteolysis of FVa and FVIIIa.87-89 Analysis of the crystal structure of human APC (PDB ID: 1AUT) revealed that there are 3 surface loops (39, 60, and 70–80), rich in basic residues, located in the protease domain of APC near the active site pocket.86,90 FVIIIa contains acidic C-terminal sequences that may potentially provide interactive sites for the basic exosite of APC.86
Figure 8C represents the results of the computational disorder analysis in human APC (UniProt ID: P04070) and shows that mentioned loops enriched in basic residues are predicted to be disordered or very flexible, thereby providing an interesting mechanistic plane for the molecular basis of APC recognition and binding of FVIII.

data Molecular mechanisms of the oligomerization of E.coli primosomal DnaT protein are uncovered in the study by Szymanski et al.91 The authors showed that the removal of the short C-terminal region dramatically affects the oligomerization process and instead of the trimer, the isolated N-terminal domain of DnaT forms a dimer.91
index 32
data Priming of the DNA strand during the replication process is catalyzed by a multiprotein-DNA complex known as the primosome.92,93 The translocation of this complex along the DNA is fueled by NTP hydrolysis. Besides being responsible for the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotide primers used to initiate synthesis of the cDNA strand, primosome plays a role in the restarting of the stalled replication fork at the damaged DNA sites.93,94 The assembly of the primosome is driven by an essential replication protein in Escherichia coli, the DnaT protein, where, the primosome assembly is initiated by recognition of a specific primosome assembly site (PAS) of the replicating DNA or the damaged DNA site by the PriA protein, or the PriB protein–PriA complex, followed by the association of the DnaT and the PriC protein.92-94 This primary DNA-protein complex is a scaffold, specifically recognized by the DnaB helicase–DnaC protein complex, which results in formation of the preprimosome. Next, the preprimosome is recognized by the primase, and a functional primosome is formed. The DnaT protein is crucial for the specific entry of the DnaB helicase into the primosome complex. 92-94
index 33
data The DnaT monomer consists of the large, N-terminal core domain that includes the first 161 residues of the protein and a small C-terminal region containing the 18 remaining amino acids.91 Disorder analysis of this protein (UniProt ID: P0A8J2) revealed that although the majority of the DnaT is predicted to be ordered, the crucial for trimerization C-terminal tail is expected to be completely disordered (see Fig. 8D). This observation is in agreement with recent notion that disordered protein tails are commonly involved in a wide array of important functions.95

data Tourdot et al. dedicated their research to the analysis of the effect of the sequential phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on function of the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1).96 PECAM-1 is a dual ITIM-containing receptor of the Ig superfamily that is capable of inhibiting immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-induced activation of B cells, T cells, and mast cells, as well as GPVI/FcRγ chain-mediated platelet activation.97 The inhibitory properties of PECAM-1 require phosphorylation of both of its ITIMs located in the vicinity of tyrosine residues at positions 663 (VQY663TEV) and 686 (TVY686SEV).96 Curiously, the ITIMs of PECAM-1 are not phosphorylated in resting cells but are phosphorylated upon cellular activation. Furthermore, these PECAM-1 ITIMs are phosphorylated sequentially, with phosphorylation of Y663 depending on prior phosphorylation of Y686.98 This sequential process of the PECAM-1 phosphorylation starts with the phosphorylation of the C-terminal ITIM by Src family kinases, which enables phosphorylation of the N-terminal ITIM of PECAM-1 by other Src homology 2 domain-containing nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs).96
Figure 8E shows that although human PECAM-1 (UniProt ID: P16284) is predicted to be mostly ordered, the residues, phosphorylation of which is crucial for its function (Y663 and Y686), are located within the highly disordered C-terminal tail.

data Aubol et al. studied the molecular mechanisms of the phosphorylation of SR splicing factors, which are the proteins possessing regions enriched in Arg–Ser dipeptide repeats known as RS domains, by a specific serine kinase SRPK1.99 Phosphorylation of RS domains is crucial for the regulation of the activities of the SR splicing factors. RS domains of SR proteins can range from 50 to over 300 residues in length, and the Arg–Ser dipeptide repeats can vary in both length and position. SRPK1 phosphorylates the prototype SR protein, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), via a directional mechanism where 11 serines flanked by arginines are sequentially fed from a docking groove in the large lobe of the kinase domain to the active site.99
Figure 8F shows that SRSF1 (UniProt ID: Q6PDM2) is predicted to be a highly disordered protein. The disordered nature of this splicing factor is in agreement with recent bioinformatics studies, which showed that human100 and yeast spliceosomes101 are enriched in intrinsic disorder, and abundant disordered regions are crucial for functions of numerous auxiliary protein factors involved in the formation of this ribonucleoprotein complex.100,101 The potential functionality of the disordered regions found in mouse SRSF1 was further supported by ANCHOR-based analysis,15,16 which revealed that this protein contains 6 AiBSs, residues 34–43, 75–87, 123–129, 144–177, 186–197, and 221–245.

data The roles of human interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) in antagonizing viral infection were reviewed by Perreira et al.102 IFITMs are representatives of a diverse group of host restriction factors fighting viral replication at different steps of the viral life cycle. The expression of many restriction factors is transcriptionally controlled by the antiviral cytokine, interferon. The interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM) 1, 2, and 3 that inhibit the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses are among the products of such interferon-stimulated genes.103-105 Among the variety of pathogenic viruses inhibited by IFITMs are influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus (DENV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV), and multitude of the filoviruses, the flaviviruses, the bunyaviruses, and the rhabdoviruses.102
index 37
data Replication of viruses requires breaching the plasma membrane of the host cell. The entry of the enveloped viruses relies on the specialized fusion proteins. There are 3 major classes of viral fusion proteins, all containing a fusion peptide that inserts into the cytolemma, thereby anchoring the 2 membranes side by side.106 Human IFITMs block the entry of viruses from each of the 3 classes of viral fusion proteins,102 by preventing viral-host membrane fusion subsequent to viral binding and endocytosis.104,107 In humans, there are 5 IFITMs (IFITM1, 2, 3, 5, and 10; corresponding UniProt IDs: P13164, Q01629, Q01628, A6NNB3, and A6NMD0). These proteins each contain 2 hydrophobic membrane-associated domains separated by a conserved intracellular loop. All of them also contain the cytosolically-located N-terminal domain (NTD) of various length.102
Figure 9 shows that the NTDs of all 5 human IFITMs are predicted to be intrinsically disordered. The likely functional role of these disordered tails is reflected in the fact that the longest NTD of IFITM10 contains 3 AiBSs, residues 8–29, 51–64, and 71–82. Shorter tails of other human IFITMs might also be involved in protein-protein interactions since all of them contain characteristic “dips,” which are commonly associated with the existence of specific molecular recognition features, MoRFs, which are short folding-prone fragments of disordered regions that are able to fold (at least partially) at interaction with specific binding partners.108-112

data Using the solution NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, Amador et al. studied the effects of mutations associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2) on the structure and dynamics of the N-terminal domain of the mouse ryanodine receptor RyR2A (UniProt ID: E9Q401).113 Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are the largest tetrameric Ca2+ release channels (∼2.2 MDa) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the electrically excitable cells. Here, RyRs resides in close proximity to plasma membrane voltage-gated dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) and respond to the DHPR activity through a direct interaction and/or indirect Ca2+ sensitivity, propagating sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal Ca2+ release, thereby playing an integral role in excitation–contraction coupling in skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes.114,115 Mutations in the RyR genes are associated with several heritable human diseases, with most disease-associated mutations making RyRs hypersensitive to activating stimuli such as Ca2+ on either the luminal or the cytosolic side of the receptor. In one of such mutations, the removal of exon 3 in RyR2 (RyR2AΔ3) results in a 35-residue deletion (N57-G91) that does not destabilize the protein.116,117 Earlier structural analysis revealed that the β-trefoil fold of this domain is rescued by the transformation of the part of the preceding region of unknown structure (residues 88–109) into the missing β-strand leading to the noticeable increase in the thermal stability of the RyR2AΔ3 domain.117 Using solution NMR analysis, Amador et al. showed that this “part of the preceding region of unknown structure” corresponds to a previously unresolved α2-helix (residues 95–104) in the wild-type RyR2A.113 Curiously, this α-helix undergoes structural transformation to a β-strand, thereby rescuing the β-strand deleted in the RyR2AΔ3 due to the removal of 3 in RyR2 gene. Therefore, the authors revealed that this newly discovered α2-helix corresponds to the region of missing electron density in the earlier crystal structures of the protein, is rather dynamic, exhibits a greater backbone RMSD compared to the remaining secondary structure elements, and is able to undergo an α-to-β transition after the deletion of residues N57-G91 in RyR2AΔ3.113 In other words, applying NMR to look at the crystallographically invisible region, an important chameleon region was discovered. Although this chameleon region is relatively small, it is really mighty, with at least some mightiness being attributed to its intrinsically disordered nature.

data Rodriguez et al. used complementary biophysical techniques for examining the ATP-induced conformational switching of the isolated ε subunit of the F0F1 ATP synthase from the thermophile Bacillus PS3 (Tε).118 The authors showed that ATP binding induces large-scale conformational transition consistent with formation of stable helical structure in the isolated Tε.118 Based on the complimentary hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry analysis it has been concluded that this transition is accompanied by a pronounced stabilization in the vicinity of the ATP-binding pocket.118
index 40
data Structurally, the ε subunit consists of a β-sandwich and 2 C-terminal helices, α1 and α2.119 Curiously, this protein is able to undergo dramatic structural rearrangements from a compact structure in the non-bound form (see Fig. 10A; PDB ID: 1AQT)119 to a highly extended open form in a complex with other subunits of the bacterial F1 complex (see Fig. 10B; PDB ID: 3OAA). The ability of the ε subunit to undergo large conformational change associated with binding to the F1 complex is determined by the presence of long IDPR at the C-terminal region (see Fig. 10C; UniProt ID: P0A6E6).

data Simon et al. investigated functional peculiarities of the Candida albicans cyclin CaPcl5.120 The authors showed that the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85 that induces phosphorylation of the transcription factor CaGcn4 is controlled via the specific binding of CaPcl5 to Pho85. Furthermore, it is shown that CaPcl5 induces its own phosphorylation at 2 adjacent sites in the N-terminal region of the protein and that this phosphorylation causes degradation of the cyclin in vivo, whereas in vitro studies indicated that this phosphorylation was accompanied by a loss of specific substrate recognition thereby representing a novel mechanism for limiting cyclin activity.120
index 42
data Activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) is regulated via binding of ancillary subunits, the cyclins,121 which also participate in targeting the kinase to specific substrates.122 Similar to other members of the CDK family, a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) CDK Pho85 can bind up to 10 different Pho85 cyclins (Pcls),123 which defines the ability of this CDK to phosphorylate different substrates leading to a wide range of Pho85 functions in cellular regulation. Among various regulatory functions of Pho85 complexed with different cyclins, is the Pho85/Pcl5-driven phosphorylation of the bZIP transcription factor Gcn4 leading to its degradation.124 Curiously, it was shown that cyclin Pcl5 coevolved with its substrate Gcn4, and in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, degradation of CaGcn4 depends on CaPcl5.125
index 43
data Mutagenic analysis of the CaPcl5 (UniProt ID: Q5AK08) revealed 2 potential CDK phosphorylation sites located in the N-terminal segment, at positions 38 and 43.120
Figure 11 shows that both of these phosphorylated sites are located within the disordered region, providing further illustration for an important notion stating that sites of posttranslational modifications in proteins are commonly located within the disordered regions.126

data Rack et al. described a discovery of a new alternatively spliced isoform of the human sirtuin-2.127 The new isoform results from skipping of exons 2–4 in the SIRT2 gene.127
index 45
data Sirtuin-2 is a member of a large family of protein-modifying enzymes, NAD+-dependent deacetylases, which are highly conserved throughout bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, and are heavily involved in modulation of various cellular processes ranging from metabolic homeostasis, to cell cycle control, to development, and to chromatin organization.128-133 In their turn, the numerous activities of sirtuins are regulated by alternative splicing, modulation of expression levels, posttranslational modifications or subcellular compartmentalization.134-137 In humans, there are 7 sirtuin homologues with distinct cellular locations. For example, Sirt1, Sirt6 and Sirt7 are primarily localized to the nucleus, whereas Sirt3, Sirt4 and Sirt5 are mitochondrial proteins, and Sirt2 is believed to have a predominant cytosolic localization.138
index 46
data Earlier, 4 variants of human SIRT2 gene were reported, with alternative splicing affecting the N-terminal part of the sirtuin-2 protein in 2 isoforms (residues 1–37 are missing in the isoform-2 and the residues 1–38 (MAEPDPSHPLETQAGKVQEAQDSDSDSEGGAAGGEADM) are substituted by residues MPLAECPSC- RCLSSFRSV in the isoform-3), and with the isoform-4 possessing changes at the C-terminus, where residues 266–271 (VQPFAS) are substituted by GRGLAG, and residues 272–389 are missing. These isoforms contain a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) within their N-terminal region which mediate their cytosolic localization139 where they have numerous functions. A recent finding a new isoform-5 with the predominant nuclear localization helped to resolve an apparent contradiction between the predominant cytosolic localization of this protein and the existence of multiple nuclear functions.127 The newly discovered alternative splicing event results in the substitution of the codons for amino acids 6–76 of the full-length ORF of isoform-1 by an arginine codon in a new isoform. This isoform-5 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, does not exhibit detectable deacetylase activity, but is properly folded and retains the ability to bind p300.127

data It has been established that the protein segments affected by alternative splicing are most often intrinsically disordered, suggesting that alternative splicing enables functional and regulatory diversity while avoiding structural complications associated with the deletion of portions of the well-folded proteins.140 In line with these observations, later studies revealed that the tissue-specific protein segments produced by alternative splicing often contain disordered regions, are enriched in posttranslational modification sites, and frequently embed conserved binding motifs.141 Also, it was proposed that alternative splicing of intrinsically disordered regions containing linear interaction motifs and/or post-translational modification sites results in complete rewiring of protein interactions.142
Figure 12 shows that in agreement with these earlier observations the alternatively spliced isoform-5 of human sirtuin-2 differs from the canonical isoform (UniProt ID: Q8IXJ6) by lacking the intrinsically disordered N-terminal tail (cf. Figs. 12A and 12B). Curiously, the ANCHOR analysis15,16 of the human sirtuin-2 revealed that this alternative splicing event removed 2 AiBSs (located at the residues 1–15 and 36–49 of the isoform-1). Therefore, functionality of siruin-2 is modulated by alternative splicing that removes potential binding sites from the disordered region of this protein.

data Parker et al. investigated the role of the amino acid sequence at the C-terminal region of human semaphorin-3 in interaction of this protein with neuropilin-1.143 The neuropilin-1 is a member of the family of type I transmembrane receptors that are essential in development, homeostasis, and pathogenesis being involved in the coordination of several important signaling events in the cardiovascular and nervous system. The members of the class III Semaphorin (Sema3) family of axon guidance molecules are among the ligands neuropilins (Nrps). Ligand binding of Nrps is a subject of the intensive research due to the involvement of these transmembrane receptors in various pathogenic conditions. It has been established that all known Nrp ligands require a C-terminal arginine (CR) for binding to a conserved pocket in the Nrp b1 domain.144-147 To better understand the mechanism of interaction between the Nrps and their ligands and to understand the role of residues upstream of the CR, Parker et al. synthesized a library of semaphorin-3 derived peptides. This study revealed that the C-1 residue (i.e., residue preceding the CR) serves the critical role of positioning the CR and C-2 residues to promote concurrent Nrp binding.143 Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the analyzed sequence (WDQKKPRNRR) is a part of long intrinsically disordered tail that spans over the last 100 residues of human semaphorin-3 (UniProt ID: Q13275, see Fig. 9F).

data Malashkevich et al. reported the X-ray crystal structure of the unmodified 3 Glu-OCN form of bovine osteocalcin.148 This is an important contribution since it adds a crucial structural information on osteocalcin, which is a small, abundant noncollagenous protein synthesized by osteoblasts, and that typically contains 3 γ-carboxyglutamic acid (3 Gla-OCN) residues generated post-translationally in a vitamin K-dependent process149,150 by the vitamin K-dependent (VKD) carboxylase.151 Earlier, based on the circular dichroism study it has been concluded that in the presence of Ca2+, the 3 Glu-OCN molecule contained significantly less α-helical structure than the 3 Gla-OCN form.152 Furthermore, it was shown that Ca2+ no longer binds to decarboxylated, unmodified osteocalcin 153 Malashkevich et al. revealed that the crystal structure of the thermally decarboxylated bovine osteocalcin contained residues 17–47, was rather similar to 3 Gla Ca2+-OCN, consisted of 3 α-helices surrounding a hydrophobic core, and contained C23–C29 disulfide bond between 2 of the helices but did not contain bound Ca2+.148 This is an interesting finding since earlier work clearly showed that in their apo-forms, modified and non-modified osteocalcin from different sources are mostly disordered.148 The explanation for this apparent contradiction can be derived from the analysis of conditions used for the 3 Glu-OCN crystallization, where protein in 20 mM NaCl and 10 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.0) was mixed with the reservoir solution containing 2.5 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M Bis-Tris propane (pH 7.0) in 1:1 ratio.148 Therefore, high ionic strength solution was used to partially neutralize the high anionic charge in the helical regions of osteocalcin. Although this approach permitted better realization of the α-helix-forming potential of the non-modified osteocalcin, the crystallization conditions are clearly non-physiological.

data Sasi et al. investigated the peculiarities of the regulation of expression of the inducible heat shock protein HSPA1A at the transcription level by several transcription factors.154 HSPA1A, together with HSPA1B are the members of the human inducible heat shock protein family (Hsp70), altered expression of which has been attributed to the pathogenesis of various diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders.155-158 It is known that the heat shock response-related proteins (including Hsp70) can be expressed during normal conditions (e.g., during the cell growth and development) or can be induced by various pathological conditions, such as infection, inflammation, and protein conformation diseases. Sasi et al. show that transcription factors HSF-1, CREB, NF-Y, and NF-kB synergistically regulate expression of the heat-shock-induced gene Hspa1a.154
index 51
data The initiation of the heat shock response is manifested by the activation of the heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), a family of related transcription factors which, in mammals, is composed of HSF-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -Y and -X.159 cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is the cAMP-regulated transcription factor that has been shown to stimulate target gene expression often via the associating with the coactivator paralogs P300 and CREB binding protein (CBP).160-162 Complex formation between CREB and CBP/P300 requires protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133.160 The nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y) is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that recognizes the Y box, which is a promoter element common to all major histocompatibility complex class II genes.163 Also, NF-Y is known to interact with a CCAAT box, which is one of the most common elements in eukaryotic promoters, found in the forward or reverse orientation.164 Furthermore, NF-Y has been reported to play a key role in the basal expression of many Hsps through this CCAAT box.165,166 NF-Y is heterotrimeric transcription factor composed of 3 components, NF-YA (subunit α, UniProt ID: P23511), NF-YB (subunit β, UniProt ID: P25208), and NF-YC (subunit γ, UniProt ID: Q13952), where the dimerization of NF-YB and NF-YC is a prerequisite for the NF-YA association and DNA binding.167 Finally, the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB; UniProt ID: 19838) is a key player in an intracellular signaling cascade regulating many inflammatory mediators.168 NF-κB is a common transcription factor present in almost all cell types and is the endpoint of a series of signal transduction events that are initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF-κB is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NF-κB1/p105, NF-κB1/p50, REL and NF-κB2/p52, and the heterodimeric p65-p50 complex.

data Figure 13 represents the results of the multiparametric evaluation of intrinsic disorder propensities of HSF-1 (A, UniProt ID: Q00613), CREB (B, UniProt ID: P16220), NF-YA (C, UniProt ID: P23511), NF-YB (D, UniProt ID: P25208), NF-YC (E, UniProt ID: Q13952), and NF-kB (F, UniProt ID: P19838) and shows that these proteins are predicted to be highly disordered. The high levels of functional intrinsic disorder is a “family signature” of the transcription factors in general.169 Furthermore, the recent analysis of the abundance and importance of IDPRs in functions of various HSFs clearly indicated that the heat shock response requires HSF flexibility to be more efficient.170 Also, the importance of intrinsic disorder in functions of various proteins involved in the innate immune response (including NF-κB) has been recently analyzed.171

data Blasic et al. analyzed the peculiarities of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the photopigment melanopsin possessing 37 serine and threonine sites that are potential sites for phosphorylation by a G-protein dependent kinase (GRK).172 Melanopsin is a member of the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family that undergoes light-dependent phosphorylation that is involved in deactivation of the photoresponse. Blasic et al. revealed that of the 37 phosphorylation sites, a small cluster of 6 or 7 sites in the proximal region of the C-tail is critical for mediating deactivation.172
Figure 14A shows that mouse melanopsin (UniProt ID: Q9QXZ9) is predicted to have long disordered C-tail (residues 380–521). This is a rather expected output since phosphorylation sites are known to be preferentially located within the IDPRs.173-175

data A recent review of Wisons et al. is dedicated to the antiviral activities of human defensins.176 These peptides with a wide range of antimicrobial activities are important components of the innate immune system. Among various antiviral mechanisms of human defensins are direct targeting of viral envelopes, glycoproteins, and capsids, inhibition of viral fusion and post-entry neutralization, inhibition of viral replication via disruption of host intracellular signaling and binding and modulation of host cell surface receptors, and augmentation and altering of adaptive immune responses.176 Of the 2 types of defensins, α- and β-defensins, found in human, significant knowledge is accumulated about the molecular mechanisms of the α-defensin action, whereas molecular details on the β-defensin activities are more disperse.176
index 55
data Defensins are small (∼29–129 amino acids) cationic, amphipathic polypeptides with a predominantly β-sheet structure stabilized by 3 disulfide bonds.176 Human α-defensins are typically shorter than β-defensins, with α-defensins staying in a range of 29–39 residues and some β-defensins can being as long as 129 residues. Search of UniProt for human defensins produces about 40 hits, of which 6 entries were α-defensins. Defensins are produced in a form of proprotein containing a signal peptide and/or a propeptide. Figure 15 represents disorder profile for several representative members of the human defensin family and shows that all proproteins possess noticeable amount of intrinsic disorder, the content of which varies significantly between different defensins. It is likely that the presence of noticeable disordered tails plays a role in the maturation of defensins since sites of the proteolytic attack are commonly located within regions of intrinsic disorder.177 It is also possible that these disordered tails serve as entropic bristle domains178 defining solubility of pro-defensins. In β-defensins, long disordered regions can have other functions. For example, the ANCHOR analysis15,16 of human β-defensin 129 (UniProt ID: Q9H1M3) revealed that this longest member of the human defensin family (there are 129 amino acids in a mature protein and 183 residues in a pro-protein) contains 4 AiBSs, residues 78–87, 89–100, 117–122, and 149–164.

data Burke et al. investigated the roles of the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the retinoblastoma protein (RbC) in interaction of Rb with the E2F transcription factor and related regulation of the Rb activities in growth suppression.179
index 57
data Deregulation of the broad-functioning tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is associated with several human cancers.180,181 Among numerous functions ascribed to this important protein is a negative regulation of cell division at the G1–S transition of the cell cycle,182 where Rb forms a growth-repressive complex with E2F transcription factors183 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Burke et al. showed that there are at least 2 different mechanisms by which RbC phosphorylation inhibits E2F binding. Here, phosphorylation of S788 and S795 weakens the direct association between the RbC and the marked-box domains of E2F, whereas phosphorylation of S788, S795, S807 and S811 induces an intramolecular association between RbC and the pocket domain, which overlaps with the site of E2F transactivation domain binding.179
index 58
data Figure 14B shows that human retinoblastoma-associated protein (UniProt ID: P06400) is predicted to have numerous disordered regions, including long disordered tails. The longest disordered region is the C-terminal tail (residues 760–928) that contains all the phosphorylation sites discussed above. According to the ANCHOR analysis,15,16 disordered tails of Rb are enriched in potential binding sites located at residues 7–20, 41–49, 57–64, 830–840, 844–860, 872–881, and 891–919. N-terminal tail of Rb contains 2 regions of compositional bias (poly-Ala and poly-Pro regions, residues 10–18 and 20–29, respectively). Known sites of the Rb interaction with LIMD1 and E4F1 are located within the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail (residues 763–928 and 771–928, respectively). The fact that phosphorylation sites of the RbC are located within the disordered region is in agreement with the general trend, where sites of many catalytically-induced posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation173 and ubiquitination184 are typically found in regions of intrinsic disorder.126,174,185-187

data Pan et al. described structural peculiarities of the human LGN-Frmpd1 complex.188 To this end, a crystal structure of the complex between the 15–350 fragment of human LGN containing 8 tetratricopeptide repeat motifs (UniProt ID: P81274) and the 901–951 fragment of human Frmdp1 (UniProt ID: Q5SYB0) was solved at 2.4 Å resolution.188 In this LGN-TPR/Frmpd1 complex, almost the entire length of LGN-TPR was well resolved, and most residues of the Frmpd1 fragment were clearly resolved adopting an extended conformation that occupied most of the concave channel formed by the 8 TPR motifs and buried a total of 2541 Å2 surface area.188 The noticeable exceptions were the 11 residues in the loop connecting the αA and αB of TPR3 (amino acids 153–163) and the 6 residues at the C terminus (amino acids 345–350) in the LGN-TPR, and the N-terminal 8 residues (amino acids 912–919) and the last 2 residues at the C terminus (amino acids 937–938) of the Frmpd1 fragment, all of which were missing in the structure of the LGN-TPR/Frmpd1 complex.188

data Leu-Gly-Asn repeat-enriched protein LGN/AGS3 in mammals (Pins, or partner of inscuteable in Drosophila neuroblasts) plays a number of crucial roles in regulation of cell polarity and spindle orientation during cellular differentiation and self-renewal in multicellular eukaryotes development.189-191 Structurally, LGN consist of 8 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs in its N-terminal half and 3 or 4 GoLoco motifs (also referred to as G-protein regulatory or GPR motifs) in the C-terminal half.192-194 Both of these motifs are crucial for protein-protein interactions,195,196 with each GoLoco motif of Pins/LGN being capable of binding to GDP-bound Gαi197 leading to stable cortical localization of Pins/LGN,198 and with the TPR motifs possessing multiple binding partners. The canonical TPR motif is a 34-amino-acid protein–protein interaction module multiple copies of are found in a wide range of proteins with diverse functions such as cell cycle regulations, gene transcription and splicing processes, protein trafficking, and protein folding.195,199
Figure 15A shows that human LGN protein is involved in a wide range of protein-protein interactions, clearly serving as an important hub protein. This interactivity analysis is done by STRING.59

data Frmpd1 protein (FERM and PDZ domain containing 1) is known to serve as a regulatory binding partner of AGS3, with a short fragment of Frmpd1 (amino acids 901–938) being shown to bind to the 8 TPR motifs of AGS3.200 Also, a 50-residue fragment (amino acids 901–951) of Frmpd1 was shown to bind to LGN with a Kd∼1 μM.188,194
index 62
data Curiously, besides the mentioned above regions of missing electron density in the LGN-TPR/Frmpd1 complex Figures 15B and 15C shows that full-length LGN and Frmpd1 proteins both belong to the category of hybrid proteins possessing some ordered domains and significant number of intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). In fact, the GoLoco motif containing C-terminal half of human LGN (residues 350–684) and the major portion of Frmpd1 (residues 511–1390) are predicted to be mostly disordered by all the computational tools used in this study. Overall, more than 40% of the LGN residues and more than 50% of the Frmpd1 residues are predicted to be disordered, which clearly places these proteins to the category of highly disordered proteins.
index 63
data Furthermore, both proteins are expected to have numerous disorder-based interaction sites. These can be identified by ANCHOR,15,16 a computational tool that relies on the pair-wise energy estimation approach developed for the general disorder prediction method IUPred,201,202 and is based on the hypothesis that long regions of disorder contain localized potential binding sites that cannot form enough favorable intra-chain interactions to fold on their own, but are likely to gain stabilizing energy by interacting with a globular protein partner.15,16 Here the term ANCHOR-indicated binding site (AiBS) is used to identify a region of a protein suggested by the ANCHOR algorithm to have significant potential to be a binding site for an appropriate but typically unidentified partner protein. This analysis revealed that there are 10 AiBSs in LGN (residues 370–379, 436–452, 491–499, 508–513, 531–537, 545–553, 566–573, 596–607, 629–638 and 661–671), whereas Frmpd1 contains 23 AiBSs (residues 534–554, 609–617, 622–636, 652–662, 704–715, 747–779, 792–804, 828–878, 896–909, 932–949, 958–967, 983–1019, 1023–1077, 1087–1100, 1106–1114, 1119–1129, 1138–1171, 1192–1220, 1245–1250, 1290–1297, 1312–1319, 1336–1342, and 1424–1431). Of special interest is the fact that the 901–951 fragment of human Frmdp1 used in the mentioned structural analysis188 is predicted to overlap with 2 AiBSs (residues 896–909 and 932–949). This is a clear indication that intrinsic disorder plays a role in the formation of the LGN-TPR/Frmpd1 complex.

data Davenport et al. reported a crystal structure of human sirtuin-1catalytic domain (residues 234–510) in complex with its C-terminal regulatory segment (CTR, residues 641–665).203 In this structure (see Fig. 17A, PDB ID: 4IG9), the catalytic NAD+-binding domain adopts the canonical sirtuin fold, whereas CTR forms a β-hairpin structure complementing the β-sheet of the catalytic domain and covering an essentially invariant hydrophobic surface.203



index 65
data Biological significance of the sirtuin family was outlined in the previous section. Human sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) is implicated in a wide range of human diseases due to the fact that this enzyme plays multiple roles in cellular processes ranging from energy metabolism to cell survival via it ability to deacetylate a wide range of substrates, such as p53, NF-κB, FOXO transcription factors, and PGC-1α.204-206 Deacetylation activity of Sirt1 was shown to be affected by various regions located within the long N- and C-termini that flank the Sirt1 catalytic domain.207,208
index 66
data Figure 17B illustrates that in agreement with a recent bioinformatics study revealing that N- and C-terminal segments of sirtuins in all known organisms are expected to be intrinsically disordered,209 both termini of human Sirt1 (UniProt ID: Q96EB6, residues 1–250 and 500–747) are predicted to be mostly disordered, whereas the central catalytic domain is mostly ordered. The ANCHOR analysis15,16 revealed that human Sirt1 contains 14 AiBSs located at the residues 1–33, 43–49, 53–125, 133–169, 184–193, 220–225, 498–503, 521–528, 549–574, 588–593, 618–624, 637–672, 691–706, and 710–744. It is important to emphasize here that the CTR (residues 641–665) used in the mentioned above structural analysis of human Sirt1203 is completely embedded within one of the AiBSs (residues 637–672).

data Davies et al. performed a systematic mutational analysis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of activation of AMSH [associated molecule with a Src homology 3 domain of signal transducing adaptor molecule (STAM)], a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) with exquisite specificity for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains and recruitment of this protein to the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery.210 The fact that the mutations AMSH were implemented in microcephaly capillary malformation (MIC-CAP) syndrome in children211 further reiterates the importance of this study. AMSH is a member of the JAMM (JAB1/MPN/MOV34) family of DUBs involved in the regulation of ubiquitin signaling by catalyzing the hydrolysis of isopeptide (or peptide) bonds between ubiquitin and target proteins or within polymeric chains of ubiquitin.212 The catalytic activity of AMSH is stimulated upon binding to STAM, which is a member of the ESCRT-0 complex. Here, the AMSH-STAM interaction is conducted through the binding of the SH3 binding motif of AMSH to the SH3 domain of the STAM.213
index 68
data Davies et al. used in their analysis the catalytic domain of AMSH (residues 219–424).210
Figure 14C represents the results of the disorder analysis of human AMSH (UniProt ID: O95630) and shows that this protein contains a long IDPR (residues 90–250) thereby illustrating that the N-terminal part of the analyzed catalytic domain is predicted to be disordered. According to the ANCHOR analysis, AMSH contains a disorder-based binding site at position 205–213 that is located in the close proximity to the known STAM-binding motif of this protein. Search of the ELM server (http://elm.eu.org/)214 for functional eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) revealed that AMSH has several ELMs in the 200–250 region, such as WDR5 WD40 repeat-binding ligand (residues 199–213), FHA phosphopeptide ligand (residues 208–214), SH3 ligand (residues 224–230), PCSK cleavage site (residues 235–239), cyclin recognition site (residues 235–239), GSK3 phosphorylation sites (residues 2070219 and 240–247) among several other ELMs.

data Freed et al. looked at the peculiarities of interaction between the E.coli transperiplasmic protein TonB with outer membrane transporters BtuB, FecA, and FhuA.215
index 70
data TonB is the E.coli inner membrane protein, which possesses a polyproline motif (residues 70–81) that may span the length of the periplasmic space216 and a globular C-terminal domain (residues 150–239) that interacts with the transporters.217,218
Figure 18A shows that the N-terminal half of the periplasmic domain of TonB protein (UniProt ID: P02929) is predicted to be highly disordered, whereas its C-terminal domain possesses significant amount of order. Figure 18B illustrates an important point that the dimer formed by the truncated periplasmic domain (residues 150–239) is a highly intertwined and elongated structure with noticeable domain swapping. A crystal structure of the TonB-FhuA complex is shown in Figure 18C. Curiously, although the entire periplasmic domain of TonB was used in the crystallization experiment, residues 39–157 and 236–239 are not seen in the resulting structure, clearly indicating that these regions are likely to preserve mostly disordered structure even in the bound form of TonB. The disordered N-terminal and C-terminal tails clearly have functional importance since they contains AiBSs, 3 at the N-terminus (residues 39–65, 92–95, and 124–164) and one at the C-terminus (residues 232–239). One more AiBS is predicted at residues 171–188.

data Stark et al. performed functional analysis of the important human chaperone, DnaJ homolog subfamily A member 1 (DNAJA1), and solved solution structure of its J-domain (residues 1–67).219 Human DNAJA1 has multiple important functions and act as protein chaperone, regulator of androgen receptor signaling, and activator of the DnaK protein. Furthermore, levels of the human DNAJA1 serve as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer, since the expression of this protein in pancreatic cancer cells is downregulated fold5-.220 NMR analysis revealed that the structure of the human DNAJA1 J-domain consists of 4 α-helices, residues 17–21 (α1), 29–42 (α2), 52–65 (α3), and 68–75 (α4) (see Fig. 19A; PDB ID: 2M6Y).219 On the contrary, the evaluation of intrinsic disorder propensity of the full-length protein suggested that DNAJA1 (UniProt ID: P31689) possesses significant amount of disorder throughout its N- and C-terminal tails (see Fig. 19B). Curiously, by ANCHOR analysis, there are 3 disorder-based binding sites in DNAJA1, residues 26–31, 85–93, and 392–397, with binding site #2 being overlapped with α2.

data In a recent comprehensive study, Romora et al. showed that the purine-rich element binding protein B (Purβ) serves as a suppressor of myofibroblast differentiation and ACTA2 repression.221 Purα and Purβ are members of a small family of nucleic acid-binding proteins that interact with purine-rich ssDNA or RNA sequences homologous to the so-called PUR element originally described in eukaryotic gene flanking regions and origins of DNA replication.222-224
Figure 14D shows that human Purβ protein (UniProt ID: O35295) is predicted to possess significant amount of functionally important intrinsic disorder. Importance of the long disordered regions in this protein is supported by finding 10 AiBSs (residues 1–6, 18–27, 47–75, 87–95, 99–106, 135–137, 142–144, 186–201, 243–256, and 277–287). In agreement with these predictions, the authors showed that several regions of Purβ were (residues 41–112, 125–210, and 125–303) were intrinsically unstable.221

data Hotter et al. provided a comprehensive review of the antiviral role of one of the host restriction factors (i.e., specific cellular antiviral factors that inhibit retroviral replication at different steps of the viral life cycle), human tetherin.225
index 74
data Among various antiviral mechanisms ascribed to tetherin are the inhibition of the release of diverse enveloped viruses by tethering them to the cell surface, induction of an inflammatory response, activation of NF-κB, action as an innate immune sensor of viral infections, activation of immune response through interactions with the immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 (ILT7, LILRA4).225 As commonly seen in the virus-host arm race, effective antiviral strategies of the host are counterbalanced by the development of novel invasive strategies, and various viruses have evolved antagonists against this host restriction factor, such as accessory HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) Vpu protein that counteracts the effects of tetherin.225
index 75
data Tetherin is a type II transmembrane protein that contains both an N-terminal transmembrane region and a C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor.226 Structurally, human tetherin exists as a disulfide-linked parallel homodimer, which is formed via the extracellular part that is involved in the formation of a canonical coiled-coil structure, where a long α-helix contains 3 cysteines that form disulfide bonds with the corresponding cysteines of a second tetherin molecule.227 It is believed that tetherin-caused viral retention relies on this unusual architecture, where one transmembrane anchor may remain in the cellular plasma membrane, whereas the other is able to stick to the viral membrane.228,229
Figure 20A represents the results of the multi-tool disorder predictions for human tetherin (also known as bone marrow stromal antigen, UniProt ID: Q10589) and shows that this protein is expected to be mostly disordered. This is not a very surprising observation since coiled-coil proteins are expected to be intrinsically disordered in their monomeric states and fold to a helical structure at the formation of coiled-coil structure caused by the interaction with corresponding partners.230


index 76
data To clarify some uncertainties in previous studies regarding formation and activities of the cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complexes Jahn et al. utilized a novel p21-PCNA fusion protein and p21 mutant proteins to understand the mechanisms of the cyclin D1/Cdk2 complex formation.231 The authors show that p21 serves as an important scaffolding protein, which is required for the formation of the functional cyclin D1/Cdk2 complex, since cyclin D1 and Cdk2 failing to complex in its absence.231
Figure 20B shows that the scaffolding protein p21 (which is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1, UniProt ID: P38936) is predicted to be mostly disordered and packed with disorder-based binding sites. In fact, there are 5 AiBSs in this relatively small protein, residues 36–41, 68–79, 100–105, 109–123, and 145–164. Using this approach, the authors were able to identify a novel Cdk2 substrate, polypyrimidine tract binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF). Figure 20C shows that PSF (UniProt ID: P23246) is predicted to have highly disordered tails. ANCHOR analysis15,16 revealed that intrinsic disorder is crucial for the PSF functions, since this protein was predicted to have 16 AiBSs (residues 1–72, 93–97, 103–146, 154–164, 171–232, 235–257, 271–287, 293–304, 430–439, 481–496, 523–541, 579–581, 596–605, 612–678, 687–696, and 703–707).

data Nguen et al. analyzed mechanistic peculiarities of the interaction between the high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and human or mouse apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I).232The authors established that the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of human and mouse ApoA-I proteins are the major players facilitating interactions of these proteins with HDL. Curiously, human CTD, being a bit more hydrophobic than mouse CTD, binds to the HDL particle with higher affinity. On the other hand, the isolated N-terminal helix bundle domains (residues 1–190) of human and mouse ApoA-I proteins binds HDL poorly.232 ApoA-I stabilizes discoidal HDL particles by forming a double-belt structure233,234 and plays a major role in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway.235,236
index 78
data ApoA-I contains a globular N-terminal domain (residues 1–43) and a lipid-binding C-terminal domain (residues 44–243).234 In the belt-like structure of the smallest discoidal HDL, 2 apoA-I molecules wrap around a small patch of bilayer containing 160 lipid molecules. The C-terminal domain of each monomer is ring-like, curved, planar amphipathic α-helix with the hydrophobic surface curved toward the lipids.234
Figure 21 shows that both human and mouse ApoA-I proteins (UniProt IDs: P02647 and Q00623) are predicted to be mostly disordered, with mouse protein possessing a bit more disordered structure. According to the ANCHOR analysis, there are 3 AiBSs in both proteins (residues 15–21, 158–164, and 221–230 in human protein, and residues 13–18, 173–204, and 207–230 in mouse ApoA-I). Figure 21C represents a structure of the human ApoA-I dimer in a complex with lipids (PDB ID: 3K2S). This model was built by uniting several synergistic experimental techniques, such as small angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast variation, isotopic deuteration of selected macromolecule components, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange tandem mass spectrometry (HD-MS/MS).237 In agreement with the results of disorder predictions, the ApoA-I dimer represents a highly intertwined double superhelix with a minimal number of intrachain contacts, which is stabilized mostly by the interchain interactions. In other words, this complex is characterized by a very large interface area, and, therefore, according to Gunasekaran et al.238 it belong to the category of 2-state dimers, where the monomers are unfolded in the unbound state and fold simultaneously with the complex formation.

data Jacobs and Coyne provided an important overview of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also known as IPS-1/VISA/Cardif).239 MAVS is the mitochondrially-located innate immune signaling adaptor regulating and coordinating signals received from 2 independent cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors to induce antiviral genes. MAVS can be regulated by host cell factors that inhibit MAVS signaling by direct protein–protein interactions, by altering mitochondrial properties or dynamics, or by post-translational modifications.239 The tip of the MAVS C-terminus contains a mitochondrial intermembrane region (residues 535–540) needed for the interaction with the mitochondrial membrane. According to UniProt, human MAVS (UniProt ID: Q7Z434) is involved in a wide array of protein-protein interactions. Among established MAVS binding proteins are: DDX58/RIG-I, IFIH1/MDA5, TRAF2, TRAF6, C1QBP, IRF3, FADD, RIPK1, CHUK, IKBKB, HCV and hepatitis GB virus B NS3/4A proteases, HHAV protein 3ABC, NLRX1, PSMA7, TRAFD1, PCBP2, IPS1, ITCH, CYLD, SRC, DHX58/LGP2, DDX58/RIG-I, IKBKE, TMEM173/MITA, IFIT3, TBK1, and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) NS1 protein (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7Z434). MAVS contains multiple alternatively spliced isoforms, sites of posttranslational modifications, and a proline-rich region (residues 103–153).
index 80
data In other words, MAVS satisfies all the major criteria to be considered as an intrinsically disordered protein. Figure 22A represents the vast interactome of MAVS evaluated by STRING. Figure 22B shows that human MAVS is predicted to be a highly disordered protein. ANCHOR analysis15,16 revealed that it contains 8 AiBSs located at the residues 123–148, 156–268, 277–290, 194–325, 338–377, 397–410, 416–449, and 463–479. Some of the AiBSs coincide or overlap with known functional sites of the human MAVS, e.g., regions of interaction with TRAF2 (residues 143–147), TRAF6 (residues 153–158 and 455–460). All this clearly indicates that MARV is a crucial intrinsically disordered adaptor of the innate immune signaling.

data Khasnis et al. analyzed the mechanisms and functional outputs of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events at Thr696 and Thr853 sites of the MYPT1 protein, which is a regulatory subunit of the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP).240 MLCP is a cytoskeleton-associated protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) that serves as a RhoA/ROCK effector, regulating dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton crucial for cell motility. The authors also showed that the C-terminal domain of human MYPT1 (residues 495–1030) was responsible for the binding to the N-terminal portion of myosin light meromyosin.240 Promiscuous interactability of MYPT1 is illustrated by Figure 23A representing the results of STRING analysis. Figure 23B shows that the very significant part of MYPT1 (UniProt ID: O14974) is expected to be intrinsically disordered, with longest disordered region covering ∼72% of protein length (residues 290–1030) and containing 18 disorder-based binding sites (residues 318–338, 374–403, 406–419, 434–454, 472–477, 492–506, 548–564, 579–588, 626–649, 666–673, 697–712, 754–774, 780–815, 853–860, 887–892, 897–917–932–943, and 1021–1030). Clearly, intrinsic disorder is crucial for function of this protein.

data Li et al. investigated structural peculiarities of the core polypeptide of the inner membrane GerD lipoprotein from Geobacillus stearothermophilus.241 Some bacteria are able to form endospores in response to adverse growth conditions.242,243 Spores formed as a result of such sporulation process are extremely resistant to various environmental insults thereby providing the bacteria with an important means to exist in the metabolically dormant state indefinitely and remain viable for hundreds of years without water or nutrients.244,245 Restoration of the favorable conditions triggers spore germination leading to the fast (within minutes) “awakening” of the normal metabolism in bacteria followed by outgrowth to generate growing cells.243,244,246 This awakening is controlled by the specific nutrient sensors, cognate germinant receptors (GRs) located in the inner membrane of the spore.
index 83
data GerD is one of such bacterial cognate germinant receptors that trigger spore germination in the presence of specific nutrients called germinants in the environments of the spores.241 Li et al. have determined the crystal structure of the 121-residue core domain of the Geobacillus stearothermophilus GerD protein (GerD60-180) that lacks the N-terminal signal and lipobox sequences (residues 1–28), the H01 and H02 helices (residues 29–59), and the C-terminal acidic tail (residues 181–195).241 By a set of biophysical techniques, this GerD60-180 was shown to form a stable, well-ordered 3-helix bundle in solution. In crystal structure, GerD60-180 trimer consists of 3 parallel polypeptide chains twisted into a superhelical, right-handed rope (PDB ID: 4O8W).241 In this elongated trimer, each of the individual GerD60-180 chains forms 8 helices (H1 to H8) linked by short turns. Structures of the individual chains can be superimposed on each other except to the loosely packed H8 helices. Helices H1–H7 in each GerD60-180 chain twist around the central axis to form 2 complete turns of a right-handed supercoil with a pitch of ∼44Å. Figure 24A represents crystal structure of the GerD60-180 trimer as a molecular surface and ribbon diagram and also shows the highly extended structure of one of the GerD60-180 monomers.241 Analysis of the overall shapes of the highly intertwined and extended monomers within the GerD60-180 trimer suggests that the formation of this trimer represents an example of the folding-upon-binding process. In agreement with this hypothesis, Figure 24B shows that the core domain of the Geobacillus stearothermophilus GerD protein (UniProt ID: Q5L3Q1) is mostly disordered.

data Forer et al. investigated the interaction between the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup), the proteasome regulatory subunit Mpa (mycobacterium proteasome ATPase), and proteasome accessory factor A (PafA), an enzyme that forms an isopeptide bond between the γ-carboxylate of a glutamate at the C-terminus of Pup and the ε-amine of a substrate lysine.247 The authors show that Pup is involved in simultaneous interaction with both Mpa and PafA, and that Mpa forms a complex with PafA, suggesting that PafA and the proteasome acts as a modular machine for the tagging and degradation of cytoplasmic proteins.247
Figure 25A represents a crystal structure of 3 Pup molecules bound to the Mpa hexamer (PDB ID: 3M9D), and the results of disorder prediction for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pup (UniProt ID: P9WHN5) are shown in Figure 25B. Pup is obviously a highly disordered protein that partially folds at binding. In fact, of 68 residues used in the crystallization experiment, only 31 are visible in structure, whereas remaining 37 residues (1–20 and 52–68) are located within the regions of missing electron density. According to the ANCHOR analysis, Pup possesses 2 disorder-based binding regions, residues 1–15 and 34–64. Curiously, Forer et al. suggested that Pup has 2 binding sites for RafA located at residues 38–47 and 51–58, and that the first RafA binding site is overlapped with the region responsible for the Mpa binding (residues 21–51).247

data Borodianskiy-Shteinberg et al. studied self-association of the human protein interacting with carboxyl terminus-1 (PICT-1), also known as the glioma tumor suppressor candidate region 2 gene product (GLTSCR2), a nucleolar protein with unknown function.248 PICT-1/GLTSCR2 is conserved among eukaryotes and is assumed to be essential for preimplantation embryogenesis and embryonic stem cell survival and proliferation.249 It was suggested that PICT-1 might act as a potential tumor suppressor, being involved in interaction with the C-terminal region of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), promoting its phosphorylation and stabilization.250 It was also suggested that PICT-1 can function as an oncogene through the inhibition of p53.249
Figure 26A represents the results of the evaluation of the interactivity of the human PICT-1/GLTSCR2 (UniProt ID: Q9NZM5) by STRING and shows a dense interaction network of this intriguing protein. Figure 26B provides an explanation for the binding promiscuity of PICT-1 by showing that this protein is predicted to be highly disordered.

data Spears et al. studied the molecular mechanisms underlying specific recognition of highly post-transcriptionally modified human tRNALys3UUU (which is the primer for HIV replication) by the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein p7.251 It is known that p7 recruits htRNALys3UUU from the host cell by binding to and remodeling the tRNA structure. An intrigue here is in the fact that htRNALys3UUU is one of the most uniquely processed tRNAs that has a broad spectrum of chemically different post-transcriptional modifications playing crucial roles in regulation of the conformation and function of this tRNA during protein synthesis.252 Using phage display approach, Spears et al. showed that p7 contains a specific htRNALys3UUU–binding region whose interaction with fully modified tRNA can be mimicked by the 15- and 16-amino acid peptides with the signature sequence of R-W-Q/N-H-X2-F-Pho-X-G/A-W-R-X2-G (where X can be most amino acids, and Pho is any hydrophobic residue).251
index 87
data HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein p7 is a 55-residues-long protein containing 2 zinc finger domains flanked by basic amino acids required for interaction with nucleic acids.253,254 In addition to the discussed above capability of p7 to specifically recognize htRNALys3UUU, the major function of p7 is to bind specifically to the packaging signal of the full-length viral RNAs and to deliver them into the assembling virion.255 As it is a highly charged basic protein, p7 binds single-stranded nucleic acids nonspecifically. Consequently, it coats the genomic RNA protecting it from nucleases and compacting viral RNA within the core. Protein p7 also serves as an RNA chaperone that enhances several nucleic acid-dependent steps of viral life, such as melting RNA secondary structures, promoting DNA strand exchange reactions during reverse transcription,256-258 and stimulating integration.259
index 88
data In the NMR solution structure of p7, regions corresponding to the 2 zinc fingers (residues 15–28 and 36–49) possess well-resolved structures, whereas residues 1–13, 32–34, and 52–55 were highly dynamic and did not converge to the unique conformations.260,261 Recent intrinsic disorder propensity analysis revealed that p7 is a highly disordered protein, with regions corresponding to the zinc fingers predicted to be more ordered than the remainder of the protein and identified as potential α-MoRFs.262
index 89
data This article represents a set of papers dealing with interesting and important proteins with diverse functions from various organisms. The only uniting theme for all these studies is the notion that they represent noticeable disorder overlooks. In fact, all proteins studied there contain intrinsic disorder. The amount of disorder ranges, and in some proteins only relative short regions are disordered or highly flexible, whereas some other proteins are almost entirely disordered. However, very often this disorder has functional implementations, and consideration of studied proteins in light of intrinsic disorder often provides interesting mechanical clues on the molecular mechanisms of their action.
index 90
data We hope that the readers will find this new series useful, since it might increase the awareness of the scientific community about importance of intrinsic disorder for protein function. We also hope to see submissions from readers who found some important intrinsic disorder overlooks in published articles. Obviously, papers in this seris will range in their size, and we envision several types of submissions, such as comprehensive reviews of unreported disorder in papers published in particular journals (i.e., similar to this review), reviews of unreported disorder in specific areas of protein-related research, as well as brief notes about overlooked disorder in individual papers. The biggest hope though is that this series will become obsolete, and protein intrinsic disorder will find its way to be robustly present in the scientific literature.

data A-42-year old female health care provider presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever, productive cough, shortness of breath, and bony pains of 2 days duration. She had a positive history of contact with a patient of similar complaints 2 days earlier to her presentation. Her past medical history was relevant for left nephrectomy in 2012 for staghorn calculus, caesarian section 3 times, and abortion once. She was obese and had been newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 however, she was not on any diabetic medication. On presentation, her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15/15, she was hemodynamically stable and her laboratory work-up was normal except for leukopenia with a white cell count of 3.7 and lymphopenia 0.39%. Her chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates, which were more prominent on the right side (Figure 1). The patient was admitted to the ward after the initial septic screen was taken for MERS-CoV, influenza AB, H1N1 (swine flu), dengue serology, and malaria tests. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and oseltamivir empirically. All her previous tests were negative. As her symptoms progressed in the medical ward, she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Her chest x-ray on the day of admission to the ICU, showed extensive bilateral consolidations (Figure 2). Due to her refractory hypoxaemia, she was electively intubated and mechanically ventilated requiring 100% Fraction of inspired oxygen for which she was started on the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) protocol which included lung protective strategies with low tidal volume as well as prone position. Her tracheal aspirates was sent again for MERS-CoV virus, using real time polymerase chain reaction assay (Roche, Berline, Germany) and the result came back positive. She was started on Peginterferon Alpha-2a, ribavirin, and intravenous methylprednisolone 60 mg every 6 hours along with other supportive measures. At some point during her initial course in the ICU, Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment was contemplated. However, on day 5 of ICU admission, she showed a fair improvement in her respiratory function. On day 12, she was on 40% FiO2 with a Partial Pressure of Oxygen in arterial blood= 103.5 mm Hg. A weaning trial was planned with sedation cessation, methylprednisolone tapered to 40 mg IV every 6 hours and Peginterferon Alpha-2a and ribavirin were discontinued. She remained hemodynamically stable, her respiratory function and radiological features showed significant improvement on her chest consolidation (Figure 3) and she started to wake up and move all her limbs. On day 13, the patient progressively became polyuric with a urine osmolarity of 95, serum osmolarity of 341, urine sodium less than 20, serum sodium 161 meq/L, chloride 119 meq/L, and blood sugar 25 mmol/L. Patient was managed with Desmopressin 2 ug subcutaneously with the plan to do brain computed tomography. However, on the same night, she suddenly became unresponsive, her GCS dropped to 3/15, and her pupils were 3 mm wide with sluggish reaction. Urgent CT brain showed right frontal hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage extending to ventricles, causing midline shift and subfalcine herniation (Figure 4 & 5). She had a normal platelet count of 347 X 109, as well as a normal coagulation profile that day. She was not on any form of anti-coagulation treatment. Furthermore, all her blood cultures were negative. She was reviewed by the neurologists and neurosurgical team, their opinion were that the intracranial bleed was acute and large, and their plan was for no surgical intervention and advised only for medical supportive measures. She clinically lost all her brain stem reflexes and her pupils became fixed and dilated. A follow up brain CT scan with contrast showed complete loss of gray and white matter differentiation of both cerebral hemispheres with large frontal hematoma, and complete effacement of extra axial CSF spaces including lateral ventricles and basal cisterns (Figure 6). The contrast enhanced CT images showed no enhancement of intracranial vessels beyond the intracranial supraclinoid segments of the internal carotid arteries. Computed tomography angiogram revealed no visualization of Middle cerebral artery, post cerebral artery and Anterior communicating arteries, and no flow within the posterior circulation. The findings of complete brain anoxia and lack of intracranial flow were consistent with brain death criteria. Due to a family psychological trauma and social issues, all her supportive measures continued for some time. On day 111 of ICU admission, she had a cardiac arrest and was declared dead on the same day.

data The Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus infection typically begins with fever, cough, dyspnea, and that rapidly progress to pneumonia requiring ventilatory and other organ support. Risk factors for the development of severe disease in addition to co-morbidities and an immunocompromised state include obesity, diabetes, and cardiopulmonary diseases. Concomitant infections and low albumin levels are predictors of severe illness. An age above 65 in a case series was observed to have high mortality.4,5 Our patient was a young primary care physician who probably got exposed to a patient with MERS-CoV infection and developed severe disease. She was about to recover but unfortunately she suddenly developed new onset diabetes insipidus and spontaneous ICH, which raised many unanswered clinical questions. The incidence of sudden onset of spontaneous ICH could not be pathologically explained in the absence of risk factors, such as uncontrolled hypertension, coagulopathy, antiplatelet medications, and cerebral aneurysms or structural abnormality. Her risk factors, include moderate obesity (99 kg), Body mass index of 35, newly diagnosed diabetes, left nephrectomy for staghorn calculus with normal renal function and obstetric history of abortion once and cesarean section 3 times. An interesting observation of severity of MERS in obese patients can be explained as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) also known as (CD26) an enzyme involved in glucose metabolism expressed on the surface of most cell types for example, T cells, lung, kidney, placenta, liver, pancreas, heart, and brain. It is expressed in large numbers in obese people compared with non-obese individuals. The DPP4 has also been shown to be the port of entry of MERS-CoV into human cells.6,7,8 Coincidentally, on the day she developed spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage her blood sugar level was 25 mmol/L, which may be a modifiable risk factor and needs emphasis on the strict glycaemic control in the management of MERS-CoV patients especially those that are obese which needs further study to know the pathogenesis in understanding the outcomes.

data As in our case, with diabetes insipidus, the possibility of altered fluid and electrolyte homeostasis can not be ruled out with MERS-CoV infection. One of the human corona viruses is MERS-CoV that include other strains like severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Gu J et al,9 reported 8 confirmed cases of brain necropsy of SARS-CoV that was found to have a direct viral infection of neuronal cells located in the cortex and hypothalamus with edema suggesting neuronal ischemia type of injury. Xu J et al10 also confirmed the direct capability of SARS-CoV of infecting the brain and central nervous system using transmission electronic microscopy and nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In our patient, diabetes insipidus and spontaneous ICH occurred after discontinuing the Peginterferon Alpha-2a and ribavirin therapy, that raises an interesting question regarding the duration of antiviral therapy in the absence of specific guidelines.10,11 Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus PCR remained positive in this patient even after one month period, this raises the question of whether the viral load and severity of infection including systemic spread to other organ systems needs to be studied in detail. Serial sampling of PCR testing from the upper, lower respiratory tracts and other body parts for example, serum, urine, stool, and cerebral spinal fluids are recommended to understand the viral replication kinetics and guide the infection control. As no CSF sample of MERS-CoV could be observed in this case due to tonsillar herniation, a possibility that could not be excluded as previously reported cases of MERS-CoV in CSF indicates the penetration of neuronal and glial cells by MERS-CoV infection. Three cases of severe neurological syndrome associated with MERS-CoV infection have been reported recently by Arabi, et al,12 but all presented with central nervous system manifestations and had significant MRI findings however, none of them developed intracerebral hemorrhage like in our case.
index 2
data In conclusion, MERS-CoV infected patients who develop critical illness often present with severe ARDS, multiorgan failure, septic shock, and encephalopathy. Since 4 years of the initial report of MERS-CoV infection, the pathophysiology of multiorgan failure, septic shock is still not understood well. Although it is less commonly involved, central nervous system can be affected either functionally or structurally by MERS-CoV infection. Appropriate management with multidisciplinary care is recommended to control and manage the viral infection which is emerging with new global challenges.

data One Health refers to the collaboration of multiple disciplines, sectors and groups working locally, nationally and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment.1 Recent examples of new and emerging diseases in animals and humans (Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian flu (H5N1), swine flu (H1NI), severe acute respiratory syndrome) show how quickly balance changes and how vulnerable humans, animals and crops are to disease outbreaks.2
3 Infectious diseases are transmitted between humans and animals by a variety of routes including direct contact (rabies), the environment (anthrax), via food (campylobacter/salmonella/brucella/bovine tuberculosis), or through bites by arthropod vectors (malaria/leishmaniasis/Rift Valley fever). As we have recently seen with the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, in our interconnected world, an animal pathogen can catch a ride on the sole of a shoe, beneath a finger nail, or in respiratory passages, and travel from one remote corner of the globe to another in less than a day. Furthermore, zoonotic illness is not a small or insignificant problem; the majority of human pathogens are zoonotic (60%) and three-quarters of new and emerging pathogens are zoonotic from wildlife species.4
5 However, One Health, which is larger than simply zoonosis (other examples include land use, water toxins, forest degradation and climate change (see online supplementary appendix A)), can have a great impact on people and the quality of their lives as well as local and national economies.
index 0
data Although perhaps the most discussed, infectious diseases are not the only relevant One Health concerns affecting the globe. Waste dumped in or near water flows through streams, rivers and lakes, affecting entire communities—crops, animals and people. Meanwhile, as the human population on the planet increases, humans are forced to live in closer proximity to both wild and domestic animals, which increases exposure to new pathogens, and forces the sharing of limited supplies of water (see online supplementary appendix B). Add to this the growing pressures to increase agricultural production, global warming with the resultant decrease in water supplies, changing microbial patterns, and deforestation, and the result is a deterioration of natural resources and a reduction in many of the protections and checks and balances that have previously been afforded to human populations.
index 1
data Despite the complex nature of these challenges, most governments have offices or units that focus vertically on specific diseases, and these offices often compete with each other for limited resources. Non-government organisations (NGOs) that align themselves with one issue or disease are often disconnected from interventions for others. It is this sort of Brownian approach to improving health that results in poor communication between disciplines, duplication of services with resulting higher costs, ignoring of common antecedent causes of poor health, and inefficient utilisation of available resources such as specialised reference laboratory facilities. Academic communities, local and national governments, and scientists worldwide are now recognising that the next logical step in problem solving is to connect interdisciplinary and government agency experts so that they can focus on the root causes of illness and the need for prevention and detection rather than responding separately and acutely to each disease. The activities and conditions of each individual, each region, and each country affect others on a variety of levels including economic, cultural, physical, social and more. While very few sub-Saharan African countries are taking steps to put these ideas into action, Rwanda is unique in that it is well on its way.
index 2
data Known as ‘the land of 1000 hills’, Rwanda has a north–south mountain range, various water sheds, rain forests and grazing lands. The nation confronts various challenges: energy sustainability, natural gas extraction from beneath Lake Kivu, a growing population, land degradation, crop raiding, wildlife poaching6; a loss of biodiversity, conversion of forests to farm land and the risk of soil overexploitation; and climate change resulting in an increasingly variable rainfall. In addition, Rwanda is one of the most densely populated (415 people/square mile) countries in the world,7 where One Health disasters can quickly affect large populations. Further, areas with high population density are more prone to food insecurity, soil erosion, decreased grazing lands, and forest degradation, which in turn leads to increased food insecurity and other measures of poor health.8
9 The eastern part of Rwanda is home to pastoral communities, which move from place to place in search of water and pastures to feed their animals. Movement is not limited to the national borders, thus pastoralists are at risk of picking up animal pathogens that can be disastrous to the livestock population in Rwanda such as foot and mouth disease and contagious bovine pleural pneumonia, both of which have become endemic.10
11 These diseases have high mortality and thus affect food security and the economic well-being of these nomads. Contagion between animals (wild and domestic) and humans does not happen in only one direction. In 2011, one of the mountain gorillas, which provide large eco-tourism revenue for Rwanda, succumbed to a human virus (human meta-pneumovirus) passed on by a tourist.12
index 3
data Through these experiences, Rwanda has learned that the eradication of hunger through initiatives such as Girinka (one cow per family (see online supplementary appendix B)), improvements in public health indicators (eg, improved maternal health, reduction in HIV, reducing malaria and other vector borne illnesses), and environmental sustainability all depend on interdependent systems, shared responsibility, involvement of the community, and collaboration across government agencies, content specialists and policies—all ideas embodied by One Health, a burgeoning global approach to integrated health. The government of Rwanda has therefore framed policies and priorities to drive toward an integrated, holistic-system approach to promoting health. Moreover, it has led to the adoption of the One Health approach by the East African Community, and Rwanda is also working with its neighbours to address regional issues that recognise the inextricable connection between the health of the country's people, animals and environment and the importance of this interconnection in development. The concept and approach of One Health provides an opportunity for the Rwandan government to expand its reforms to address important interdisciplinary, intersectoral health problems and work to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. Rwanda has therefore set out to achieve, in policy and practice, what has yet to be implemented across any nation—an evidence-based, interconnected system to address One Health problems.13
index 4
data Rwanda's One Health response (table 1) goes beyond the traditional approach of disease surveillance, outbreak investigations and response. It also includes new competencies around leadership/governance, efficiencies in resource utilisation, disaster management, delivery of healthcare, systems-related approaches, and vigorous attention to training for life-long learning. In the past, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources, other government organisations, academic institutions and NGOs had separate roles with little overlap. Despite limited resources, Rwanda's One Health approach is intended to develop collaborative leaders committed to improving health equity and social justice by addressing health disparities that impact on efficiency by promoting shared resources and collaboration among those working at the animal (wildlife, livestock and companion animals), ecosystem and human health interface.
index 5
data Another important goal of Rwanda's One Health Strategy is to empower and mobilise various experts and lay workers and establish a One Health workforce to prepare, coordinate and manage epidemiological outbreaks of infectious, toxic or environmental health concern or health events. For example, the Rwandan strategic plan requires the inclusion of veterinarians, wildlife experts and environmental experts who work on emergency management committees. Similarly, disease surveillance of both zoonotic and potential zoonotic disease is monitored by a multidisciplinary team. This is a bottom-to-top approach that involves community health workers (CHWs), community-based animal health workers, NGOs, health clinics, hospitals, park rangers, farmers and domestic animal owners. These experts are prepared and trained to act rapidly and collaboratively given evolving information.
index 6
data One idea moving forward is to create a hub-and-spoke network using the nearly 45 000 CHWs (spokes) linked to hubs (centres of expertise) through mobile phone technology. Perhaps one day the CHWs will be rebranded ‘One Health CHWs’ (OHCHWs) given that they are well situated to quickly identify unusual events or problems affecting humans, animals or ecology/agriculture. Hub centres would be connected via the internet to district centres and eventually to a central repository and command centre. OHCHWs would routinely collect local information on the health of humans, animals and crops and notify hub centres when there are sudden changes or concerns.
index 7
data Interprofessional team work and collaboration such as that mentioned above has the best chance of becoming routine if education and training starts early and focuses on core competencies that stress problem solving, team work, leadership, creativity, conflict management, communication, project management, transparency and outcomes. However, despite extensive capacity-building efforts in Rwanda, there remains an undersupply of physicians, veterinarians and environmental scientists. To combat this problem, several colleges and universities have recently coalesced into the University of Rwanda to improve opportunities for interprofessional training, interdisciplinary scholarship and research innovation, and work force expansion. Harmonisation of the environmental health programmes offered by the old veterinary college and the old ‘human health sciences’ college has now provided another great opportunity to articulate One Health as a cross-disciplinary approach.
index 8
data As a start, Rwanda has created a One Health curriculum embedded in its Master of Global Health Delivery programme which integrates collaborative problem-solving approaches with elements of infectious disease, epidemiology, ecology, environment, finances, food safety and leadership. Plans are also underway to integrate One Health modules into the Master of Public Health and Epidemiology courses, developing a 1-month community-focused field boot camp in 2017 to further train animal–human–ecosystem providers in integrated problem solving, leadership and communication skills related to One Health. Finally, a vibrant One Health students' club for undergraduates was established in 2012, the first of its kind in the region, that links virtually with other health sciences schools around the world who share a commitment to learning related to One Health. It consists of students from veterinary medicine, environmental health, nursing, medicine and agriculture. The goal of the club is to bring One Health skills, approaches and attitudes to a new generation of scientists and problem solvers who will embrace the importance of working together to serve the community rather than working in silos.
index 9
data While Rwanda has been forward thinking in developing a One Health-focused national strategic plan, several important factors have enabled this innovative change. Following the 1994 genocide, Rwanda has benefited greatly from two decades of social and political stability from transparent governance with local, regional and national representation. The elaborate network of CHWs has been a key element in primary healthcare delivery. Rwanda's rapid response teams previously developed in response to outbreaks of Ebola and yellow fever in neighbouring Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo are now being used to address other One Health problems by coordinating surveillance, information sharing, and planning of risk reduction and communication.
index 10
data The country also benefits from many international academic partnerships involving medicine, public health, veterinary medicine, agriculture and the environment. However, until recently, most of these partnerships were solitary and often focused on one disease or a narrow sub-population. In the new model, driven by the One Health strategic plan, interventions are highly coordinated. Finally, within Rwanda there is relative equity between female and male health professionals, making it easier to address important gender and cultural issues relevant to improving One Health.
index 11
data Resolution of One Health problems often pits one discipline or sector against another with resultant perceptions of ‘winners’ and ‘losers’, at least in terms of resources. Other barriers that need to be overcome include a lack of experts trained in a One Health approach, competition for government resources, battles over curricular time in training programmes, issues related to licensing and certification, and interdisciplinary turf wars. There has long been a need to develop infrastructure such interdisciplinary laboratories and structures that promote interdisciplinary, interministerial collaboration focused on problem solving (eg, childhood diarrhoea linked to bovine mastitis). In Rwanda, the key ministries related to One Health have already coalesced to form a ministerial ‘Social Cluster’ which meets monthly, with the goal of ensuring that there is little competition for resources between ministries and that shared issues are addressed collectively. However, additional efforts to create a robust infrastructure that would support collaboration and interdisciplinary training would further enable Rwanda's One Health response.
index 12
data The One Health approach is in evolution and will still require a cultural shift in Rwanda as power and organisational structures become realigned to provide new reporting structures, new offices, new education and new lines of communication. Moving forward, Rwanda's government needs to fund the implementation and embrace the concept of ‘oneness’ such that the separate ministries can develop common policies, approaches and evaluations that can feed into action plans and improved health infrastructure such as providing better equipped laboratories and data tracking. Academics need to think beyond the traditional silos (medicine, public health, veterinary medicine, engineering, etc) in ways that will stimulate innovation and encourage problem solving.
index 13
data As in most countries, the health of Rwanda's people and its economy are highly dependent on the health of the environment. One Health offers the opportunity to recognise shared interests, set common goals and drive toward team work to benefit the health of a nation. Rwanda's One Health approach provides innovations that are important to both acute (disaster or emerging zoonotic disease) and chronic (animal, human and ecosystem) health problems and offers synergy across systems, resulting in improved communication, development of a new generation of systems-thinkers, improved surveillance, decreased lag time of response, and improved health and economic savings. Given the interconnectedness of our global community in which humans, animals and the environment impact on each other and do not respect geopolitical boundaries, it may be time for all countries and their neighbours to follow Rwanda's lead and consider incorporating One Health principles into their national strategic health plans.

data Respiratory tract infection is a leading cause of death worldwide [1]. Laboratory testing is required to identify the underlying etiologic agent of respiratory infections, as they commonly present with similar signs and symptoms [2]. The xTAG respiratory viral panel (xTAG RVP) FAST v2 is a multiplexed molecular assay for respiratory viral infections manufactured by Luminex Corp. (Austin, TX, USA) that has been routinely used in our clinical laboratory to detect respiratory viruses.
index 0
data In December 2015, Luminex introduced the NxTAG respiratory pathogen panel (NxTAG RPP), following approval from United States Food and Drug Administration. Both the NxTAG RPP and xTAG RVP FAST v2 have the same number of viral targets, including influenza A virus (A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and A/H1N1/2009 strains), influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4 (PIV 1-4), enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronaviruses (OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus. The NxTAG RPP has two additional atypical bacterial targets, namely Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Recent studies have compared the performance of the new NxTAG RPP with that of other respiratory panels such as the BioFire FilmArray RVP [34], RespiFinder-22 [5], Anyplex II RV16 [6], and xTAG RVP FAST v2 [7]. Overall, these reports demonstrated that the NxTAG RPP is at least comparable to, if not better than, some of the comparators. Here, we assessed the clinical performance of the NxTAG RPP versus the xTAG RVP FAST v2 in detecting respiratory viruses.
index 1
data This study was approved by the local institutional ethics board (National Healthcare Group Domain-Specific Review Board A, reference: 2016/00044) and was performed between May and December 2015. Here, 142 de-identified clinical respiratory samples submitted to the Molecular Diagnosis Centre of the Singapore National University Hospital were included (see Table 1 for the list of viral pathogens included). Additionally, 12 external quality assessment (EQA) samples from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) infectious disease respiratory panel, received in year 2015, were tested (Table 2). Total nucleic acid was extracted with the Qiagen EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 on the BioRobot EZ1 extractor (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
index 2
data All samples were initially tested with the xTAG RVP FAST v2 as part of our routine clinical service. In brief, the extracted nucleic acid (10 µL) was used for target amplification by multiplex reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The PCR product (2 µL) was hybridized to a bead mix; next, reporter dye was added in a new reaction vessel, which was sealed and incubated. The amplification and hybridization/incubation were performed on the Applied Biosystems Veriti thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wohlen, Switzerland), as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Signal acquisition was performed on the MAGPIX instrument (Luminex Corp). After testing, the extracted nucleic acids were immediately frozen at −80℃ until further testing.
index 3
data Residual frozen archival samples were retrieved and tested with the NxTAG RPP, a closed-tube nucleic acid assay containing premixed lyophilized reagents for target amplification, PCR product hybridization/incubation, and detection. All procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted nucleic acid (35 µL) was added to resuspend the preplated lyophilized bead reagents in the vessel. Multiplex RT-PCR, bead hybridization, and reporter dye incubation were performed on the Veriti thermal cycler, as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Finally, the vessel was placed onto the MAGPIX instrument for signal acquisition.
index 4
data When discordant results were found between the two assays for a particular sample, a third method—a laboratory-developed, clinically validated RVP—was used for confirmation. The laboratory-developed RVP methodology is described in Supplemental file S1. In this scenario, the result concurrent between any two of the three methods was considered true. The concordance rate and Cohen's kappa coefficient of the two Luminex assays were determined by using GraphPad QuickCalcs (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).
index 5
data Of the 142 clinical samples tested, 131 had concordant results, 60 and 71 of which were negative and positive, respectively. The 11 discordant samples containing metapneumovirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E, and eight influenza A/H3N2 viruses tested positive in the laboratory-developed RVP assay and thus, were considered true positives (Table 1). The overall concordance rate between the two Luminex assays was 92.3% (131/142) with a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.757–0.932), indicating a substantial degree of agreement. Of the discordant samples, the xTAG RVP FAST v2 missed eight influenza A/H3N2 viruses and one coronavirus 229E, while the NxTAG RPP missed one enterovirus/rhinovirus and one metapneumovirus. On the basis of the CAP results, both NxTAG RPP and xTAG RVP FAST v2 correctly identified all the pathogens in the samples tested.
index 6
data The NxTAG RPP detected the presence of M. pneumoniae in one of the samples included in this study. This finding was confirmed by using a commercial real-time PCR assay for Mycoplasma, the Venor GeM qEP Mycoplasma detection kit (Minerva Biolabs GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Subsequent sensitivity testing using the lyophilized 10 colony-forming units (CFU) Sensitivity Standards (Minerva Biolabs GmbH) showed that NxTAG assay was capable of detecting M. pneumoniae strain down to 10 CFUs/PCR.
index 7
data We assessed the clinical performance of the new NxTAG RPP against that of the xTAG RVP FAST v2 using a representative panel of viral pathogens and negatives. Notably, the seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus was not detected in our local population, and was not included in this study. This strain appears to have been completely replaced by the pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus since 2009/2010 [8]. Overall, both assays showed comparable sensitivity and specificity for all viral targets, except for the influenza A/H3N2 virus. Notably, the xTAG RVP FAST v2 showed poor performance in influenza A/H3N2 subtyping, which may be due to primer mismatches. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has compared the performance of the NxTAG RPP with that of the xTAG RVP FAST v2; however, missed detection of influenza A/H3N2 was not reported [7]. It is unclear whether the missed detection by the xTAG RVP FAST v2 was related to the variant H3N2 virus reported by the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta) recently [910]. Nonetheless, the inability to simultaneously detect and subtype these H3N2 viruses is a major hindrance for clinical laboratories to return test results within established turn-around-time. The influenza A/H3N2 virus is a clinically significant respiratory pathogen. Therefore, the ability to rapidly provide subtype information is important during an outbreak or in epidemiologic investigations. By contrast, the influenza A/H3N2 primers in the NxTAG RPP have been updated to detect these untypable strains. Our study suggests that existing xTAG RVP FAST v2 users should switch to the NxTAG RPP, which has better sensitivity for influenza A/H3N2, without a significant drop in sensitivity for the other respiratory viral targets.
index 8
data Enterovirus/rhinovirus infections comprised 27.5% (39/142) of our study population. However, the inability of both Luminex assays to distinguish enterovirus from rhinovirus infections in patients lowers their overall clinical utility. This distinction is clinically important, particularly for septic workups in neonates and other vulnerable/immunocompromised patients, as enteroviruses can disseminate to cause systemic infection and involve multiple organs, whereas rhinoviruses generally do not [11]. The RVP assay can detect multiple viral targets simultaneously. Our study revealed nine cases of co-infections. Most of the co-infections involved enterovirus/rhinovirus (78%), consistent with results of previous studies [1213], and 43% of these cases involved enterovirus/rhinovirus and RSV.
index 9
data A limitation of the current study is that the numbers per target were relatively low for influenza B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 4, coronaviruses, adenovirus, and bocavirus, and may not be sufficient to reflect the true diagnostic capability of the two assays. Such low detection rates of these viruses have been observed elsewhere [1213]. Additionally, we were unable to evaluate the performance of the bacterial panel in the NxTAG RPP, as the additional bacterial targets were not detectable by the xTAG RVP FAST v2 or the laboratory-developed RVP. Further-more, we detected only a single case of M. pneumoniae with the NxTAG RPP.
index 10
data Experimentally, the xTAG RVP FAST v2 assay had a turnaround time of 5 hr for 48 samples. However, the need to manipulate post-amplification products presents an inherent risk for laboratory contamination. Moreover, the need to remove the seal from the vessel during the detection presents another potential source of sample cross-contamination, leading to false-positives. Besides cross-contamination, high background noise (Fig. 1) is another source of false-positives, which is commonly associated with the Luminex bead-based suspension array technology due to suboptimal hybridization conditions involving temperature divergences or operator variations. In contrast, the NxTAG RPP is a closed-tube, one-step system, which abolishes the need for post-amplification product manipulation and removal of the seal. The hands-on time is significantly reduced with the simplified workflow, alleviating process variations and giving a turnaround time of <4 hr for 48 samples. Overall, the streamlined workflow minimizes cross-contamination and background noise. However, initially, where the extracted nucleic acid is used to resuspend the preplated lyophilized bead reagents, the repeat pipetting can cause possible cross-over contamination. Finally, the NxTAG RPP can process between 1 and 96 samples per run, without wasting additional consumables or reagents. This flexible throughput can cater to the needs of laboratories with different and/or variable volume demands.
index 11
data In conclusion, the two Luminex assays performed comparably for most pathogens, with the NxTAG RPP having the advantages of being able to detect atypical bacteria and having better diagnostic sensitivity for certain viruses.

data A total of 80 fecal swabs were collected from 30 diarrheic and 50 healthy dogs in animal
hospitals and households, respectively, in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam from 2013 to 2015.
Their ages ranged from 2 months to 13 years. Swab samples were dissolved in 2

data For differentiation of CCoV subgenotypes, primers 1bF, 5′-TTG ATT CAA AGA TTT GAG TAT
TGG-3′ and CCVSR, 5′-GTT AGT TTG TCT AAT AAT ACC AAC ACC-3′, were used to amplify the
5′-terminal region of the S gene [30]. RT-PCR was
performed using a TaKaRa RNA LA PCR TM kit (AMV) Ver.1.1 (Takara, Otsu, Japan).
RT was carried out with random 9-mer primers at 30°C for 10 min, 42°C for 30 min and 99°C
for 5 min, and then, PCR was performed. Amplified fragments were purified using a QIAquick
PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) for sequencing.

data Felis catus whole fetus-4 cells (fcwf-4 cells; ATCC Number: CRL-2787)
[11] were maintained in Dulbecco’s minimum
essential medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) containing 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma-Aldrich), 100 units/ml
penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Life
Technologies). Fcwf-4 cells in 6-well plates were inoculated with extracts from
CCoV-positive feces and were then incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
Cells were observed daily for cytopathic effects (CPE). If there were no CPE, cells were
blind-passaged five times.
index 5
data Isolated CCoV was plaque-purified three times. Briefly, 10 PFU of CCoV were inoculated on
fcwf-4 cells in 6-well plates. After 1 hr of adsorption, inoculum was removed, and 0.8%
agarose in DMEM containing 10% FCS was overlaid on cells. After the appearance of CPE,
plaques were picked up by tips and dissolved into DMEM. This plaque-purification procedure
was repeated three times.
index 6
data The sequence of the 3′-terminal one-third of the viral genome from S gene to poly A was
determined by RT-PCR using TaKaRa RNA LA PCRTM kit (AMV) Ver.1.1 (Takara). RT
was carried out with random 9-mer primers at 30°C for 10 min, 42°C for 30 min, 99°C for 5
min and 4°C or oligo dT-Adaptor primer at 42°C for 30 min, 99°C for 5 min and 4°C for 5

index 7
data In order to amplify the S gene of CCoV-IIa, PCR was performed using the following pimers:
1bF, CCVSR, CCVS2CenF, 5′- CTA TTC TGT GAC ACC ATG TG-3′ [30] and 2bR. Amplified products were confirmed by electrophoresis on 0.8%
agarose gels and were then purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). The
nucleotide sequences were determined by an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer auto sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.). Sequences were assembled and analyzed using
GENETYX® ver.8 (Software Development Co., Tokyo, Japan).
index 8
data VN testing was performed using fcwf-4 cells as described previously [26, 30] with
modifications. CCoV-IIa fc1, isolated in Japan in 1990 [1], and CCoV-IIb CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015 strain, which was isolated and
plaque-purified three times in this study, were used. Briefly, dog sera were inactivated
at 56°C for 30 min before VN test. Equal volumes of two-fold serially diluted sera and
virus solution containing 2.0 × 103 PFU/ml of CCoV were mixed
and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Then, 50 µl of this mixture was
inoculated onto fcwf-4 cells monolayer in 24-well plates. After adsorption at 37°C for 1
hr, inoculum was removed, and 0.8% agarose (Lonza, Rockland, ME, U.S.A.) in DMEM
containing 10% FCS was overlaid. Infected cells were incubated at 37°C until CPE was
observed, followed by fixing with phosphate-buffered formalin and staining with crystal
violet. When the number of plaques was less than 75% of those in control wells, diluted
sera were judged to be positive. Titers were expressed as the highest serum dilution
showing 75% plaque reduction or more.
index 9
data Phylogenetic relationships based on the nucleotide sequences of the 5′-terminal region of
S genes or complete S genes were analyzed using distance-based (neighbor-joining) with
MEGA 7.0 software [13]. Bootstrap values were
calculated based on 1,000 replicates.
index 10
data Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact probability tests were used for statistical analysis.
P values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.
index 11
data Eighty-seven dogs (43.3%) were positive for anti-CCoV-II antibody. Prevalence of
anti-CCoV-II antibody in dogs aged over 3 years (52.0%) was significantly higher than that
in dogs aged under 1 year (28.6%) (P<0.05).
Prevalence of anti-CCoV-II antibody in Vietnamese (39.2%) was significantly lower than
that in other breeds (63.3%) (Table
1). Antibody titer against CCoV-II ranged from 1:10 to 1:320 (data not
shown).
index 12
data To detect CCoV-I and CCoV-II genes in fecal samples, RT-PCR was carried out using fecal
samples from 30 diarrheic and 50 healthy dogs. Although CCoV-I was not detected, CCoV-II
was detected from two diarrheic dogs (6.7%) and five healthy dogs (10%, 5/50) (Table S1).
Next, nucleotide sequences of 5′-terminal region of the S gene were analyzed to
differentiate subgenotypes of CCoV-II and were deposited into the DNA database of Japan
(DDBJ; Accession No. LC190901-LC190907) (Table S1). Phylogenetic analysis based on the
5′-terminal region of the S gene showed that one and six strains belonged to CCoV-IIa and
CCoV-IIb, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table S1). Vietnamese CCoVs-IIb formed one cluster and was similar to Chinese
ferret badger DM95/2003 (95.4–95.6%) and CCoV/NTU336/F/2008 (95.2–95.6%). Vietnamese
CCoV-IIa was similar to Raccoon dog GZ43/2003 (95.6%) (Fig. 1).
index 13
data Next, the full length of the S gene of CCoV/dog/HCM27/2014 was also determined (4,362 nt,
DDBJ Accession No. LC190906). Phylogenetic analysis based on complete S genes showed that
Vietnamese CCoV/HCM47/2015 was similar to Chinese ferret badger CoV/DM95/2003 (95.9%) and
CCoV/NTU336/F/2008 (95.2%), and that Vietnamese CCoV-IIa, CCoV/dog/HCM27/2014 was similar
to Raccoon dog CoV/GZ43/2003 (97.4%) (Fig. 2).
index 14
data One CCoV-IIb was successfully isolated from a healthy dog (female, six years old) and
designated as CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015. For further analysis, the isolate was plaque-purified
three times, and the nucleotide sequence of the 3′-terminal one-third CCoV genome from the
S gene to poly A (8,995 nt) was determined. Surprisingly, the plaque-purified CCoV had a
large deletion in the ORF3abc and partial E genes (1,165 nt), and a short deletion in the
ORF7b gene (60 nt). Next, we determined nucleotide sequences of the original virus in the
feces, confirming that the original virus in feces did not have any deletions (DDBJ
Accession No. LC190907) (Fig. 3).
index 15
data To compare antibody titers against CCoV-IIa and -IIb, 60 sera were examined by VN testing
using fc1 and plaque-purified CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015, respectively. The results showed that
positivity of antibody against CCoV-IIb (58.3%) was slightly higher than that against
CCoV-IIa (51.7%) (Table 2). Four additional dogs became positive for anti-CCoV-IIb antibody, and nine
dogs had significantly higher antibody titers (over 4-fold) against CCoV-IIb than CCoV-IIa
(data not shown).
index 16
data In this study, the prevalence of anti-CCoV-II anibody was 43.3%, suggesting that CCoV-II
has been spreading among the dog population in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. Seroprevalance of CCoV
infection was 15.8% in the open population and 40.8% in kenneled populations in Australia,
44.1% in Japan, 90.8% in Italy and 96.5% in Turkey [1,
9, 19, 24]. Sera from dogs in Vietnam reacted more strongly with
CCoV-IIb than CCoV-IIa (Table 2), indicating
that CCoV-IIb is the major genotype in Vietnam. The results of RT-PCR in this study also
supported the notion that CCoV-IIb is the predominant genotype circulating in domestic dogs
in Vietnam (Fig.1, Table S1).
index 17
data The prevalance of antibody against CCoV-II increased with age (Table 1). Similar results were reported in Turkey [9]. Older dogs must have more opportunities to be infected
with CCoV. Seroprevalence of CCoV-II in imported breeds (63.3%) was significantly higher
than that in domestic breeds (39.2%). There have been similar reports in Japan [27, 29],
indicating that many dogs are infected with CCoV while housed with breeders or in pet
shops.
index 18
data In this study, two diarrheic dogs (6.7%) and five healthy dogs (10%) were positive for
CCoV-II, but no dogs were positive for CCoV-I. One of seven Vietnamese CCoVs strains was
positive for CCoV-IIa, and others were positive for CCoV-IIb. Positivity for CCoV-I and
CCoV-II in feces of dogs has been reported in Japan (CCoV-I: 53.2% and CCoV-II: 56.9%)
[28], China (CCoV-I: 4.5% and CCoV-II: 23.9%)
[32], Italy (CCoV-I: 25.2% and CCoV-II: 36.3%),
United Kingdom (CCoV-I: 15.0% and CCoV-II: 20.6%), Hungary (CCoV-I: 22% and CCoV-II: 15%),
Greece (CCoV-I: 37% and CCoV-II: 36%) [7], Brazil
(CCoV-I: 47% and CCoV-II: 63%) [5] and Korea (CCoV-I:
22% and CCoV-II: 10%) [12]. In Vietnam, CCoV-II,
especially CCoV-IIb, may be more predominant among the dog population than CCoV-I. However,
CCoV-I infection in Vietnamese dogs should be examined by RT-PCR using further primer sets
specific for CCoV-I.
index 19
data Both CCoV-IIa and IIb cause enteritis, and the lesion is limited to the small intestine
[17]. On the other hand, pantropic CCoV-IIa spread
systemically and caused hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, neurological signs and leukopenia
[8, 16].
CCoV-IIb also spread systemically and infected to internal organs, when it co-infected with
canine parvovirus [16, 21]. However, there were no significant differences in CCoV infection
between diarrheic dogs and healthy dogs. CCoV infection may not be a serious problem in
Vietnamese dogs. Further studies will be required to clarify the pathogenicity of CCoV in
Vietnam.

data Phylogenetic and sequence analysis based on S genes showed that Vietnamese CCoV-IIa
(CCoV/dog/HCM27/2014) and CCoV-IIb (CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015) were smilar to CCoVs in China,
Chinese ferret badger CoV/DM95/2003 and raccoon dog CoV/GZ43/2003, respectively (Fig.2). These Chinese CoVs were found in
live animal markets in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China [31], suggesting that Vietnamese CCoVs might have the same
ancestor as these Chinese CCoVs. In our previous study, canine distemper virus in Vietnam
was also similar to Chinese viruses [20].
index 21
data We succeeded in isolation of CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015 and plague-purified the isolate three
times for further characterization. Surprisingly, the plaque-purified CCoV had a large
deletion in the ORF3abc and partial E genes (1,165 nt) and a short deletion of ORF7b (60 nt)
(Fig. 3). Deletions in ORF3a (47 nt) and ORF3b
(31 nt) in CCoV 1–71 [18], a deletion in ORF3b (38
nt) in CB/05 [8] and a deletion in ORF7b (154 nt) in
341/05 [7] have also been reported. These data
indicate that ORF3abc and ORF7b are not essential and that they are stable in viral
replication in vitro, but not in vivo. In feline CoV, it
was reported that ORF3abc plays an important role in the efficient macrophage and monocyte
tropism [2] and that deletion of ORF7b is correlated
with a loss of virulence [10]. In our preliminary
data, two dogs orally inoculated with plaque-purified CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015 did not show any
clinical signs, but anti-CCoV antibody increased after challenge. Now, we are examining the
virulence of this plaque-purified CCoV. Importantly, virus isolation is important for
characterization, but rapid adaptation by passage of coronaviruses should be monitored.
index 22
data In conclusion, this is the first characterization of CCoV in Vietnam. In Vietnam, CCoV-IIa
and CCoV-IIb, but not CCoV-I, are co-circulating among domestic dogs. This plaque-purified
CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015 may be a good tool for diagnosis of CCoV infection, because of its rapid
viral growth in vitro and antigenicity. Furthermore, the virus is a
candidate for inactivated and/or attenuated live vaccines, because genetic markers in
ORF3abc and 7b are able to differentiate it from field isolates.

data Cells continuously encounter a wide variety of intrinsic and extrinsic stresses that damage the integrity of DNA (Lindahl and Barnes, 2000). Mitochondrial respiratory chain generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are the most prevalent intrinsic source of DNA damage. Extrinsic sources of DNA damage are ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet (UV), and genotoxic chemical agents, including chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., camptothecin, doxorubicin, and etoposide). Both of the sources attack DNA and produce DNA lesions or breaks (Dipple, 1995). If not properly repaired, these damages are capable of blocking DNA replication and transcription, leading to mutations or genome aberrations, which consequently give rise to various human diseases, such as cancer.
index 0
data To maintain genome stability against the stresses, cells operate DNA damage response (DDR) to detect DNA lesions, signal their presence, and promote their repair (Harrison and Haber, 2006; Harper and Elledge, 2007; Rouse and Jackson, 2002). If DDR alone cannot completely handle DNA damage, cells employ an additional defense mechanism, called DNA damage tolerance (DDT) that allows DNA replication with the bypass of DNA lesions, which eventually is repaired at a later stage (Sale et al., 2012). Both DDR and DDT are tightly controlled by post-translational protein modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation, and modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs). Ubiquitin and UBLs are henceforth referred to as the ubiquitin family. When cells are seriously damaged by genotoxic stresses and cannot be repaired by DDR and DDT, they are then committed to kill themselves through a suicide process, called apoptosis. PTMs are also critically involved in the control of apoptotic process for selective and permanent elimination of damaged cells.
index 1
data UBLs are small-size polypeptides whose three-dimensional structures are strikingly similar to that of ubiquitin, although the similarity in their amino acid sequences to ubiquitin significantly varies (Kerscher et al., 2006). So far more than ten UBLs have been identified and they include ATG8, FAT10, HUB1, ISG15, NEDD8, SUMO(1–4), UFM1, and URM1 (Jentsch and Pyrowolakis, 2000). Most UBLs are conjugated to specific target proteins by a three-enzyme cascade system (E1, E2, and E3) that resembles ubiquitination. Protein modifications by ubiquitin and UBLs are reversible processes that are catalyzed by isopeptidases, called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and UBL-specific proteases (ULPs), respectively. These reversible protein modification processes play important roles in the regulation of key cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, deregulation of these modification systems results in a wide variety of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and immune diseases.
index 2
data Of the ubiquitin family, the roles of ubiquitin, SUMO, and NEDD8 in the control of DDR and DDT as well as of apoptosis have been extensively studied and reviewed in detail (Brown and Jackson, 2015; Dantuma and van Attikum, 2016; Jackson and Bartek, 2009; Roos et al., 2016). However, relatively little is known about the function of ISG15 under DNA damage conditions. In this review, we overview the recent progress made in exploring the functional significance of ISG15 and its reversible modification of target proteins in the regulation of cellular responses to genotoxic stress and thus in their implication in human diseases, particularly cancer.
index 3
data The product of interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is the first reported UBL (Haas et al., 1987). This 15-kDa protein consists of two ubiquitin-like domains corresponding to the N- and C-terminal regions, which share 29% and 31% amino acid sequence identities with ubiquitin, respectively (Haas et al., 1987; Jeon et al., 2010). Like ubiquitination, ISG15 is conjugated to target proteins by an enzymatic cascade: ISG15-activating E1 enzyme (UBE1L), ISG15-conjugating E2 enzyme (UBCH8), and ISG15 E3 ligases (e.g., HERC5 and EFP) (Kim et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2006; Yuan and Krug, 2001; Zhao et al., 2004; Zou and Zhang, 2006). This conjugation process can be reversed by the major deISGylating enzyme UBP43, also called USP18 (Malakhov et al., 2002). ISG15 is not present in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, and Saccharomyces, indicating that its functions are restricted to higher animals.
index 4
data ISG15 is robustly induced by type-I IFNs, lipopolysaccharide, and viral infection (Farrell et al., 1979; Kim et al., 2002; Loeb and Haas, 1992; Malakhova et al., 2002). One of the major components of the innate immune response is the activation of type I IFN signaling pathways (Platanias, 2005; Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001). Proteomic analysis has revealed that regulatory proteins involved in antiviral IFN signaling pathways, such as RIG-I, IRF3, MDA-5, STAT1, JAK1, and filamin B, serve as targets for ISG15 modification (Arimoto et al., 2008; Jeon et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2005). Moreover, ISG15 and its conjugation to target proteins have been implicated in impairment of viral replication in vivo (Lu et al., 2006; Malakhova and Zhang, 2008; Okumura et al., 2008). Conversely, certain viruses induce their own proteins that can block the expression of ISG15 (e.g., NS3/4A) or generation of ISG15-conjugated proteins (e.g., NS1B) or promote deconjugation of ISG15 from its target proteins (i.e., deISGylating enzymes, including OTU, PLpro, and viral E3 protein), thus abrogating the antiviral immune responses (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007; Lindner et al., 2005; Loo et al., 2006; Ratia et al., 2008; Yuan and Krug, 2001; Zhao et al., 2016). In addition, mice lacking ISG15 or UBE1L exhibit increased susceptibility to infection by certain viruses, including influenza B virus, herpes simplex virus, and/or Sindbis virus (Giannakopoulos et al., 2009; Lai et al., 2009; Lenschow et al., 2007), further indicating the role of ISG15 and its conjugation of target proteins in antiviral responses.
index 5
data ISG15 is also induced by genotoxic stresses. UV was first shown to increase the level of ISG15 transcripts by about four fold in human skin fibroblasts (Gentile et al., 2003). Camptothecin, an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, also increases the level of ISG15 mRNA and this increase requires protein synthesis and a functional p53 protein (Liu et al., 2004). Significantly, camptothecin-mediated induction of ISG15 is independent of IFN signaling pathway and ISG15 conjugates formed by the drug treatment are different from those generated by type I IFNs, indicating that different signals induce ISGylation of different target proteins (Park et al., 2016). Moreover, the ISG15 gene has a putative p53-responsive element (p53RE) for its induction in addition to IFN-sensitive response element (ISRE) (Reich et al., 1987). Collectively, these findings suggest that ISG15 and its conjugated proteins participate in the control of cellular responses to DNA damage.
index 6
data The p53 tumor suppressor coordinates cellular responses to DNA damage as well as to other stresses, such as abnormal oncogene activation, telomere erosion, and hypoxia (Green and Kroemer, 2009; Riley et al., 2008). Under normal conditions, the level of p53 protein is kept low by several E3 ligases-mediated ubiquitination. Among them, MDM2 is the major ubiquitin E3 ligase that leads to degradation of p53 by proteasome. Interestingly, the expression of MDM2 is induced by p53, thus forming a negative feedback loop for down-regulation of p53 (Ashcroft and Vousden, 1999; Oliner et al., 1992; Wu et al., 1993). Under stressed conditions, however, the interaction of p53 with MDM2 and other negative regulators is disrupted by phosphorylation and acetylation, leading to stabilization and activation of p53. The activated p53 then binds to p53REs for transcriptional activation of its target genes (e.g., BAX, CDKN1, and PUMA) that mediate cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, depending on the degree of stresses (el-Deiry et al., 1994; Miyashita and Reed, 1995; Nakano and Vousden, 2001).
index 7
data Recently, we have shown that p53RE is present not only in the ISG15 gene but also in the promoter regions of the genes encoding UBE1L (E1), UBCH8 (E2), and EFP (E3), all of which are henceforth referred to as the ISG15-conjugating system (Park et al., 2016). Accordingly, treatment with DNA-damaging agents, such as UV, camptothecin, and doxorubicin, markedly induces both the mRNA and protein levels of UBE1L, UBCH8, and EFP in p53+/+ cells, but not in p53−/− cells, and this induction can be abrogated by caffeine, an inhibitor of ATM/ATR kinases (Sarkaria et al., 1999), which phosphorylate Chk1 and p53 for the expression of p53. In addition, DNA damage-mediated induction of the ISG15-conjugating system is independent of type I IFNs, indicating that p53 alone can positively regulate the expression of ISG15 and its conjugation system.
index 8
data DNA-damaging agents are capable of inducing ISGylation of p53 as well as overexpression of the ISG15-conjugating system (Park et al., 2016). Lys291 and Lys292 serve as the major ISG15-acceptor sites in p53. Of two known ISG15 E3 enzymes, EFP, but not HERC5, acts as a p53-specific ligase. HERC5 lacks p53RE, consistently with the finding that the ligase is not induced under DNA-damaging conditions. Intriguingly, ISGylation of p53 promotes its transcriptional activity and in turn in the expression of its downstream target genes, including CDKN1, MDM2, BAX, and ISG15, as well as of its own gene. This increase of the p53 activity is mediated by the ability of ISG15-conjugated p53 to promote its phosphorylation and acetylation and thereby to increase its affinity toward p53RE. Furthermore, p53 ISGylation suppresses cell growth and tumor development in vivo. Knockdown of ISG15 or any of the ISG15-conjugating system or Lys-to-Arg mutations of the ISG15 acceptor sites in p53 strongly attenuates DNA damage-induced p53 activity and in turn its tumor suppressive function (Park et al., 2016). Thus, cells appear to operate a novel feedback circuit between p53 and the ISG15-conjugating system for positive control of p53 tumor suppressive function under genotoxic stress conditions.
index 9
data The p53 protein family consists of p53, p63, and p73. Different isotypes can be generated from their genes due to the presence of different promoters (Levine et al., 2011). For example, the p63 gene generates two types of transcripts: one for p63 having an N-terminal transactivation domain (TA) and the other for p63 lacking TA domain (ΔN). In addition, both TA and ΔN transcripts are differentially spliced at their 3′ ends to generate the p63 proteins with unique C-termini, termed α, β, γ, δ, and ɛ (Melino, 2011). Similar to p53, TAp63 isotypes can activate transcription from p53-responsive genes, which induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, thus also functioning as tumor suppressors (Flores et al., 2002; Suh et al., 2006).
index 10
data Of the p63α isotypes, ΔNp63α has the transactivation inhibitory domain (TI) but lacks the TA domain and therefore can dominant-negatively suppress transcriptional activation of the p53 family member by binding to their TA domains (Guo et al., 2009; Sayan et al., 2007; Yang et al., 1998), contributing to its anti-apoptotic, mitogenic, and tumorigenic functions. ΔNp63α is the most abundant p63 isotype in many proliferating epithelial cells, such as MCF10A (Carroll et al., 2006; Mills et al., 1999; Yang et al., 1999). Significantly, its expression is frequently amplified in human epithelial cancers, such as squamous cell carcinomas, advanced cervical carcinomas, and human breast carcinomas, supporting its role in tumorigenesis (Hibi et al., 2000; Leong et al., 2007).
index 11
data DNA-damaging agents, such as camptothecin and doxo-rubicin, induce ISGylation of ΔNp63α in MCF10A and various epithelial cancer cell lines, including HNSCC013, HCC1937, and FaDu (Jeon et al., 2012). Lys139 and Lys324 serve as the ISGylation sites in ΔNp63α. Upon exposure to the DNA-damaging agents, caspase-2 is activated, although with an unknown mechanism(s), and cleaves off the TI domain from ISGylated ΔNp63α, but not from its unmodified form, suggesting that ISG15 molecules conjugated toΔNp63α act as molecular scaffolds for recruiting activated caspase-2. Asp452, Asp469, and Asp489 are the cleavage sites in ΔNp63α. The cleaved TI domain is exported to the cytoplasm from the nucleus, thus losing its ability to bind the TA domain and inhibit the transcriptional activity of TA domain-containing p53 family members in the nucleus. Under the same stress conditions, TAp63α, is also ISGylated and cleaved by caspase-2 and its TI domain is released to the cytoplasm, thus yielding a transcriptionally active form of TAp63α.
index 12
data Furthermore, ISGylation of ΔNp63α abrogates its ability to induce cell growth and tumor formation (Jeon et al., 2012). Knockdown of ISG15, Lys-to-Arg mutations of ISGylation sites, or Asp-to-Ala mutations of cleavage sites by caspase-2 strongly potentiate the ability of ΔNp63α to promote anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor development in vivo. These findings indicate that ISG15 and its conjugation to ΔNp63α play critical roles in suppression of tumor-igenesis particularly in epithelial cancer cells under genotoxic stress conditions. As both camptothecin and doxorubicin are well-known anticancer drugs, these findings also provide a molecular basis for chemotherapeutic drugs against ΔNp63α-mediated cancers.
index 13
data Notably, cisplatin, unlike camptothecin and doxorubicin, is unable to induce the ISG15-congugating system and ΔNp63α ISGylation, although it also acts as a DNA-damaging agent as well as an anticancer drug. However, cisplatin is capable of inducing cAbl-mediated phosphorylation of TAp73, which causes the dissociation of TAp73 from ΔNp63α and in turn the promotion of its transcriptional activity to induce apoptosis (Leong et al., 2007). Thus, cisplatin, like camptothecin and doxorubicin, impairs the dominant-negative function ofΔNp63α toward TA domain-containing p53 family members, although it does not exhibit any effect on ISGylation and caspase-2-mediated cleavage of ΔNp63α, unlike camptothecin and doxorubicin.
index 14
data The sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) serves as a processivity factor as well as a platform for recruiting necessary components for DNA replication. Moreover, PCNA is critically involved in DNA lesion bypass by acting as a scaffold that recruits essential components for DDT (Moldovan et al., 2007), indicating that PCNA plays an additional key role in the maintenance of genome stability and cell survival under DNA damage conditions.
index 15
data When replicating cells encounter DNA damage, PCNA undergoes numerous PTMs, such as ubiquitination and sumoylation (Bergink and Jentsch, 2009; Jackson and Durocher, 2013; Mailand et al., 2013; Ulrich and Walden, 2010). UV induces mono-ubiquitination of a highly conserved Lys164 residue in PCNA by the ubiquitin E3 ligase RAD6-RAD18 complex (Hoege et al., 2002). This PCNA ubiquitination triggers the replacement of replicative DNA polymerases, such as Polη, by damage-tolerant Y family of DNA polymerases, including Polδ, for translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) (Bienko et al., 2005; Kannouche and Lehmann, 2004; Kannouche et al., 2004; Lehmann et al., 2007; Stelter and Ulrich, 2003). TLS polymerases bypass DNA lesion and therefore DNA replication can proceed without the need of removal of the damage and the risk of fork collapse (Sale, 2012; Sale et al., 2012). However, TLS polymerases lack proofreading activity and frequently incorporate incorrect nucleotides, therefore are potentially mutagenic (Loeb and Monnat, 2008; Matsuda et al., 2000; Sale, 2012; Sale et al., 2012). Thus, error-prone TLS polymerases have to be released from PCNA after DNA lesion bypass for preventing excessive mutagenesis.
index 16
data Upon DNA damage by UV, PCNA consisting of three identical subunits is first mono-ubiquitinated (at Lys164) for recruitment of Polη and thus for initiation of TLS, as previously documented in detail (Bienko et al., 2005; Kannouche and Lehmann, 2004; Kannouche et al., 2004; Lehmann et al., 2007; Stelter and Ulrich, 2003). After DNA lesion bypass, the ISG15 E3 ligase EFP, but not HERC5, is tethered to mono-ubiquitinated PCNA, and generates mono-ISGylated PCNA (at Lys168), leading to formation of PCNA conjugated with both ubiquitin and ISG15 in different subunits (Park et al., 2014). ISGylated PCNA then recruits PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) motif-containing USP10 for deubiquitination of PCNA, which causes the release of Polη from PCNA for termination of TLS. EFP conjugates an additional ISG15 to PCNA at Lys164, thus forming PCNA ligated with two ISG15 molecules in the same subunit, likely for preventing mono-ubiquitination at Lys164 and re-recruitment of Polη. Finally, UBP43 is induced at a later period and cleaves off ISG15 molecules from PCNA for reloading of replicative DNA polymerases and resuming of DNA replication. For this sequential modification of PCNA (i.e., mono-ubiquitination, ISGylation, deubiquitination, ISGylation, and deISGyation), expression of the proteins responsible for the processes (i.e., RAD6-RAD18, ISG15 and EFP, USP10, and UBP43) is induced in order after UV irradiation, although it remains mysterious how the timely expression of each component of PCNA modifications is regulated. Moreover, knockdown of any of ISG15, EFP, and USP10 as well as Lys-to-Arg mutations of the ISGylation sites in PCNA lead to a dramatic increase in UV-mediated mutation frequency with a decrease in cell survival (Park et al., 2014). Thus, PCNA ISGylation appears to play a crucial role in termination of error-prone TLS after DNA lesion bypass for escaping from excessive mutagenesis and thereby maintaining genome stability.
index 17
data Type I IFNs and viral and microbial infections induce the expression of ISG15. Further, its conjugation to target proteins plays essential roles in innate immune responses, such as anti-viral and anti-microbial functions. Recent studies indicate that ISG15 and its conjugating system, including UBE1L (E1), UBCH8 (E2), and EFP (E3), are also induced under DNA damage conditions and this induction is positively regulated by p53. Moreover, p53-mediated increase in the levels of ISG15 and its conjugating system leads to ISGylation ofΔNp63α and PCNA as well as itself. ISGylation of p53 forms a positive feedback loop for its transcriptional activation, resulting in the expression of p53-downstream target genes for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis under DNA damage conditions. On the other hand, DNA damage-induced ISGylation of ΔNp63α negatively regulates its anti-apoptotic and mitogenic functions by caspase-2-mediated destabilization. In addition, reversible PCNA ISGylation relays a signaling pathway to turn off error-prone TLS after DNA lesion bypass for suppressing UV-induced mutagenesis as well as for resuming normal DNA replication. Thus, it appears clear that ISG15 and its conjugation to target proteins play a crucial function in the control of cellular responses to genotoxic stresses and in turn in suppression of DNA damage-mediated tumor-igenesis.

data This study examines the implementation of a public health accountability and performance management system featuring declared principles of continuous quality improvement (CQI) in Ontario, Canada. CQI is an approach to the management and improvement of organizational services and processes (Dilley et al. 2012; Nicolucci et al. 2010; Radawski 1999). The approach stands in contrast to quality control and assurance by virtue of its focus on identifying opportunities to improve work processes as opposed to identifying individualized problems and maintaining a status quo (Dever 1997). CQI relies heavily on performance measurement and analysis, as well as on the involvement of leadership and front-line staff in decision-making processes (Kosseff 1992; McLaughlin 1987; Radawski 1999).
index 0
data The adoption of quality improvement approaches such as CQI in public health has been a recent and popular development (Capacity Review Committee 2006; Corso et al. 2010; Dilley et al. 2012). Despite this phenomenon, there exists a limited body of empirical evidence on the impact of quality improvement approaches in public health settings (Corso et al. 2010; Dilley et al. 2012; McLees et al. 2014; Riley et al. 2012). Moreover, valid and reliable frameworks for assessing the integrity and impact of such systems in public health are still emerging. In contrast, development of CQI in healthcare settings has been much more extensive, dating back to the late 1980s (Chinnaiyan et al. 2012; Radawski 1999; Rex et al. 2002).
index 1
data This study uses Shortell et al.'s (1998) four dimensions of CQI as an analytical framework for assessing a public health quality improvement initiative in Ontario (Figure 1). The four dimensions of CQI represent an assessment framework derived from systematic reviews of empirical healthcare research. In addition, Shortell et al.'s earlier research on the cultures of high-performing organizations is used to augment the cultural dimension of the adapted framework (Shortell et al. 1995). For instance, developmental cultures featuring an emphasis on risk-taking, innovation and change, as well as group cultures with strong teamwork and participation, found the greatest success in supporting CQI initiatives. Hierarchical and rational cultures that stress bureaucratic norms and narrow definitions of achievement were found to act as barriers.
index 2
data Within clinical health research fields, the four dimensions of CQI have received empirical validation (Bennett and Crane 2001; Forsner et al. 2008; Solomons and Spross 2011). One example includes Forsner et al.'s (2008) controlled study of evidence-based practice in Swedish psychiatric care. The investigators examined the implementation of clinical guidelines and found that in the test group, in which the four dimensions of CQI were applied, the reported guideline compliance was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than in the control group.
index 3
data Many of the key factors presented in the four-dimensions framework overlap with those emphasized in the public health quality improvement literature. For instance, in their qualitative study of 51 quality improvement initiatives in various public health departments in the US, Riley et al. emphasized leadership and appropriate performance measures, which are also highlighted in the strategic and technical dimensions of CQI (Riley et al. 2012). Resource inadequacy was a key barrier in McLees et al.'s (2014) study of 74 public health agencies involved with the National Public Health Improvement Initiative in the US, as it is in the strategic dimension of Shortell et al.'s framework. The importance of training and education in quality-improvement concepts and techniques is also stressed in both the public health literature and the technical dimension (Corso et al. 2010). Knowledge transfer and exchange, supportive organizational cultures and the influence of implementers in decision-making outlined in the structural, cultural and strategic dimensions were factors that did not appear to have extensive profiles in the public health literature.
index 4
data The public health system in Ontario features several key stakeholders, including the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC), boards of health and local public health units. The Ministry provides provincial stewardship and 75% of core funding for the public health system and is also charged with upholding key legislation. Boards of health are municipal and regional public health governing bodies that are responsible for overseeing their corresponding public health units and providing them with the remaining portion of core funding. Public health units are the agencies that deliver programs and services in their respective jurisdictions.
index 5
data Following the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Ontario, a major reform of the system was initiated by the Minister of Health (Smitherman 2004). This reform included the declarative adoption of CQI as a means of pursuing performance improvement (Capacity Review Committee 2006; Law et al. 2013; MOHLTC 2008, 2011). CQI adoption has taken the form of a system of accountability and performance management, currently undergoing implementation across 36 municipal and regional public health jurisdictions. The system is composed of (1) the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS), which outline the program and service requirements for boards of health and public health units, as well as broad goals and outcomes across each area of public health; (2) accountability agreements between the Ministry and boards of health and their public health units that establish specific performance indicators and targets related to areas of the OPHS; (3) organizational standards that articulate management and governance requirements for boards of health and public health units; and (4) reporting requirements for the collection and analysis of performance measurement information (MOHLTC 2008, 2011, 2013).
index 6
data A mixed-methods approach consisting of key informant interviews and a web survey was used to assess Ontario's public health accountability and performance management initiative. All data collection and analysis were conducted by the principal author with university ethics approval and editorial feedback from co-authors. This study used many elements of a case study approach, such as interview and survey methods and triangulating analysis, which have been used extensively in the field of implementation research (Long and Franklin 2004; McDermott 2004; Mischen 2006). Research conforming to case study characteristics has also been used to investigate public accountability and performance management (Christensen and Lægreid 2014; Hildebrand and McDavid 2011).
index 7
data Key informant interviews were conducted in three public health units (sites A, B and C). Sample selection was conducted to reflect diverse implementation contexts characterized by both rural and urban service environments, as well as municipal and regional governance. In total, 20 semi-structured key informant interviews of ~1 hour in length were conducted. All interviews were tape-recorded and professionally transcribed in full. Public health unit informants included executive, management and specialists in various areas of public health, such as chronic and infectious disease prevention and control. These groups of individuals represent the primary implementers of the province's public health accountability and performance management intervention.
index 8
data Four separate interviews with representatives of the MOHLTC were also conducted during the same period of data collection. These interviews also followed a semi-structured approach and included individuals directly involved with the development of the province's quality improvement initiative.
index 9
data Interview questions for both public health unit and Ministry informants included specific and broad items relating to facilitators and barriers within the four dimensions of CQI. For example, Ministry and public health informants were asked to choose characteristics of Shortell et al.'s (1995) organizational cultures typology (i.e., teamwork, risk-taking, bureaucratic, efficiency-focused) that best reflected their work environment. Broader items included questions asking informants to independently identify what conditions or factors were critical to the success of implementing Ontario's system of accountability and performance management.
index 10
data In addition to key informant interviews, a web survey of public health managers was conducted. Targeting all public health managers in each of the province's 36 health units, recruitment involved contacting each senior executive to seek approval and access to their organizations. In total, 12 public health units agreed to participate and provided contact lists of public health managers; 97 surveys were distributed; 53 questionnaires were returned, providing a response rate of 54.6%. This sample, while only covering one-third of all public health units, represented a near-equivalent distribution of rural, mixed rural and urban, and urban jurisdictions. Survey questions, for example, asked about manager discretion, relating to stakeholder decision-making in the strategic dimension; resistance to the intervention, relating to barriers in the cultural dimension; familiarity with components of the initiative, as well as sentiment regarding performance measurement pertinent to the technical dimension; and prospective thoughts on the use (and usefulness) of collected information for performance management and quality improvement.
index 11
data Directed content analysis was applied to qualitative data by using an initial coding frame informed by pre-existing empirical and theoretical literature (Hickey and Kipping 1996; Hsieh and Shannon 2005; Potter and Levine-Donnerstein 1999). Strong, anomalous themes were then coded separately. Established codes were then matched with facilitators and barriers of Shortell et al.'s (1998) four dimensions of CQI and analyzed. Quantitative data collected using keysurvey.com were recoded for descriptive and bivariate analyses using SPSS. Two-sided Fisher's exact tests (p ? 0.05) assessed association because of the small survey sample (Daya 2002). Findings from the survey supplement the qualitative data, and all presented findings did not feature missing data (n = 53).
index 12
data The strategic dimension emphasizes the importance of leadership, communication and inclusion of all stakeholders in decision-making. Analysis of interview data found statements of strong leadership expressed by each public health unit. Local-level leadership in quality improvement focused mainly on outcomes in priority populations, such as immigrants from countries with endemic infectious diseases. Ministry informants identified leadership as a key driver of implementation efforts and acknowledged its strength within public health units, who they felt shared their interest in showing high performance. A Site-B informant confirmed this leadership sentiment:
index 13
data Communication relating to the initiative was evident from interview findings identifying various forums for the development and conveyance of its elements. Several public health unit informants noted that the province's new system of accountability and performance management had prompted both internal and external dialogue, which has since increased their understanding of performance objectives and quality improvement more broadly. Site-A stood out as a particularly strong example of this:
index 14
data Similarly, a large proportion of survey respondents reported moderate or great familiarity with many components of the intervention, including accountability agreements (96%), performance targets (98%) and reporting requirements (94%).
index 15
data Implementer inclusion in decision-making was mixed. Although many public health unit informants cited participation in committees and working groups related to the CQI initiative, their influence over final decisions varied. In some cases, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, public health agents were able to negotiate “more realistic” performance targets.1 In other instances, local informants noted that the Ministry took a hard line in making decisions despite concerns voiced by the field. For example, when a prescriptive OPHS protocol for tuberculosis follow-up was challenged because of evidence of alternative best-practice, requests to change the protocol were denied by provincial decision-makers. One Ministry informant corroborated this dynamic by stating their interest in the input provided by the field, but the decisions ultimately rested with those holding authority over legislation:
index 16
data Informants in each of the three public health unit interview sites raised concerns over the narrow timelines for achieving targets. One Ministry informant noted that many of the targets are set to 100%, matching with the OPHS, and that even public health units with low baselines would be expected to meet targets within the first two years of implementation.
index 17
data Divergence between the Ministry and the field was expressed in terms of provincial and local health priorities. Some informants argued that targets set by the Ministry such as senior falls were not a priority in their jurisdiction or, generally, a major responsibility of public health because of small target populations and the many determinants outside of their control. Although many public health unit informants acquiesced to the province's quality improvement initiative, each of the local public health unit interview sites placed greater emphasis on internal systems of performance management to foster meaningful performance improvement. For instance, one Site-A informant stated:
index 18
data Despite the implied and explicitly stated opportunity cost created by misalignment in local and provincial priorities apparent in interview findings, 74% of survey respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that an emphasis on provincial performance measurement and target achievement would interfere with the quality of program and service provision at a local public health level.
index 19
data Resource inadequacy was often referenced in relation to the cost neutrality of the intervention and the current public health funding model, more broadly. While public health unit informants highlighted the quality of their agencies' human resources, some did not consider general resourcing to be adequate for achieving all targets – a phenomenon that was reflected by nearly one-third of surveyed public health managers. Issues of increased burden on public health units to show compliance with provincial targets and fulfill local priorities were, in some cases, compounded by rapidly expanding local populations that the current public health funding model does not compensate for. For example, one Site-B informant explained:
index 20
data Ministry informants acknowledged the need for greater equity in the public health funding model, although some were not convinced that public health performance improvement required additional funding, but rather greater efficiency. Other barriers such as work overload did not have a strong profile in the data, although some public health unit and Ministry informants speculated that smaller, rural health units may struggle with performance expectations related to intensive analytical tasks such as population health assessment.
index 21
data Facilitators of the cultural dimension are distinguished by openness, collaboration, teamwork and learning. At the local level, all three public health unit interview sites exhibited at least some of the characteristics of developmental and/or group culture. Site-A exhibited many characteristics of group culture, such as teamwork and participation. Organizational hierarchy appeared fairly flat, and even front-line workers were said to be involved in program decision-making, collective priority-setting and performance monitoring. One Site-A informant noted:
index 22
data Site-B appeared to be an equally distributed mix of developmental, group and rational cultural types – emphasizing efficiency and achievement of OPHS requirements. Group culture was apparent in reference to the interdisciplinary team-based approach to program and service provision. Leaders also regarded teamwork as an important value of their culture, as illustrated by instances of participative management in various program areas. Developmental culture emerged in the context of the health unit's internal, evidence-based approach to CQI planning, which allowed for informed innovation and risk-taking. A Site-B informant expanded by stating:
index 23
data Site-C presented a dominant developmental culture. Risk-taking and innovation were often regarded as very important aspects of the organization's culture. These aspects of developmental culture were contextualized in terms of evidence-informed decision-making, which was paradoxically argued to reduce risk at the same time. Risk-taking in the development of strategic plans and priorities and examples of innovative programming were highlighted as proof of the health unit's commitment to a developmental culture. An example of one Site-C informant reflecting on the health unit's organizational culture explained that:
index 24
data Resistance to change, unrewarded achievement, and hierarchical and rational organizational cultures are regard as barriers to the cultural dimension. In this regard, there was limited evidence of an approach for rewarding achievement and good performance related directly to the province's CQI initiative. However, some public health unit interviewees argued that celebrating achievement of targets was important – something that their health units did internally when goals were achieved or improved upon. Site-A provided an example of this:
index 25
data Moreover, there was some uncertainty about the level of support for facilitating factors and the presence of barriers such as hierarchical cultural norms. On the issue of whether the system was primarily intended to promote learning (a key characteristic of CQI), those surveyed in the area of chronic disease prevention were significantly more uncertain than respondents from other areas (p < 0.02). Likewise, 84.3% of the survey sample agreed or strongly agreed that the initiative was primarily concerned with maintaining compliance with public health practice and performance expectations – resembling a quality assurance orientation. In addition, respondents in the area of emergency preparedness were more likely to disagree (p < 0.02) with the statement that data generated from the provincial initiative would be used to improve performance.
index 26
data Training opportunities and the quality and availability of data are the primary facilitators in the technical dimension. In Ontario, training in quality improvement, and CQI specifically, manifested mainly at the local level, with public health units providing instruction to staff on strategic planning. Guidance in program and service provision was evident through provincial OPHS protocols, but these materials did not relate specifically to quality improvement training. A Site-A informant reflected on this gap:
index 27
data Gaps in training and data systems can be precursors to frustration and false starts, according to Shortell et al. (1998). Guidance from the Ministry on how public health units were to achieve performance targets or improve was limited. Moreover, some guidance materials, such as the previously mentioned tuberculosis protocol, were criticized by Site-C informants for not reflecting best available evidence and local expertise:
index 28
data Considerable concern with the quality of performance measurement information relating to the provincial initiative was raised by all parties. The choice of population health outcomes as measures of public health performance was identified as problematic because of externalities that made attributing public health outputs difficult. Some performance indicators were perceived as unreflective of public health performance by health units. For instance, the tobacco use indicator was highlighted as one such problematic measure:
index 29
data Ministry informants generally agreed that information systems needed to be improved and that this task was a difficult one. However, Ministry informants also noted that where evidence was weak, best-practice information was used in place of causal linkages between OPHS requirements and outcomes. One Ministry informant explained:
index 30
data The structural dimension focuses on effective forums of communication for facilitating learning throughout an organization or system. In Ontario, the CQI initiative is supported by several communication forums, such as accountability agreement working groups, committees and monthly teleconferences amongst public health specialists, leadership and the Ministry. At a local level, several public health unit informants noted active lines of communication between themselves and other public health units pertaining to collaborative projects, research and other forms of knowledge production and exchange. In contrast, some Ministry informants stated that public health units do not typically work cooperatively or collaboratively because of jurisdictional protectionism. This divergence in perspectives was reflected in informants' testimony:
index 31
data Within the structural dimension, the lack or limited use of communication mechanisms related to the quality improvement initiative fosters an inability to produce knowledge and diffuse it within systems. Ambiguity relating to how information would be fed back to public health units and used for quality improvement was apparent and highlighted by local informants:
index 32
data Ministry informants stated that performance information would allow for “discussion” with public health units. Some public health unit informants speculated that these discussions would include questions of what barriers to performance existed. One public health unit interviewee noted that performance information lacked the context to address why the results were the way they were. Meanwhile, several other informants argued that their public health unit would have to provide additional, unsolicited information to explain their performance achievement. One Site-B informant explained:
index 33
data In contrast to the provincial initiative, all public health unit interview sites described specific internal processes of quality improvement such as balanced scorecards, evaluation, reporting and strategic planning elements. Only 55% of survey respondents believed the province's system of accountability and performance management had the intent of providing learning opportunities and improving performance.
index 34
data This study is limited by its small public health unit sample, which, although offers valuable insight into a nascent quality improvement process, ultimately, cannot represent the broader set of units. Also, while boards of health are acknowledged to be important stakeholders in Ontario's public health system, members were not included in this study because of unsuccessful recruitment. Furthermore, this study offers a snapshot of an initiative in a fluid environment and in its very early stages. Changes to the approach are expected, which have potential implications on the perceptions of informants. This also means that evidence of outcomes resulting from the presence of facilitators and barriers was beyond the scope of this study.
index 35
data This study illustrates the applicability of Shortell et al.'s (1998) four dimensions of CQI as a framework for understanding public health quality improvement. The study also represents one of the first attempts to examine the implementation of a CQI initiative across a complex public health system using an empirically derived and validated framework from the healthcare field. Insight provided by the framework relating to facilitators and barriers of CQI implementation has largely confirmed disparate public health research on the topic (Corso et al. 2010; McLees et al. 2014; Riley et al. 2012; Shortell et al. 1998). This confirmation is a promising indicator that the framework may hold value as a tool for public health decision-makers developing and implementing CQI systems. Finally, future research should test the four-dimensions framework in other public health environments and, more importantly, examine the linkages between the framework's indicated outcomes and attributable facilitators and barriers.

data To the Editor,

data The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an important emerging infection in the present day. Since its first origin in Saudi Arabia in 2012, this disease has already spread to several countries worldwide. The outbreak in Asia in 2015 is a present concern (1, 2). The big epidemic in Korea is a big challenge. In addition, other Asian countries including China and Thailand also have the problem of MERS. In this severe respiratory problem, a high mortality is reported. In cardiology, the effect of MERS is an interesting topic. First, there is no doubt that cardiac patients can get the infection and that this might lead to a difficulty in diagnosis. In a report from Saudi Arabia, 28% of MERS cases have underlying cardiac disease (3). The latest case in Thailand is an Omani patient with underlying heart disease and visited a private hospital in Thailand to seek a cardiologist. Of interest, this case was delayed diagnosed to have MERS. Second, patients with underlying heart disease can be more severe than general cases without underlying diseases (2). There is no doubt that special medical concern should be given to patients with underlying disease. Finally, the important question is whether MERS virus can cause direct cardiac pathology or not. A recent animal model study clearly stated that viral RNA could be seen in cardiac tissue, implying direct cardiac pathology (4).

data Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are among the most common diseases to affect humans with typical symptoms, such as rhinitis, cough, fever, and sore throat.1 Most of these infections are caused by viruses. Bacterial RTIs are less common and often develop after a viral infection. In children <5 years, 95% of the sore throat cases are caused by viruses; 85%–95% in adults. Only in the group of 5- to 15-year-old children, this percentage is reduced to 70%.2 Viruses associated with RTIs are picornaviruses (human rhinoviruses [HRV]), coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human coronavirus [hCoV] OC43), ortho- and paramyxoviruses (influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), and respiratory syncytial virus), and adeno- and herpesviruses.3
index 0
data RTIs are transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets or indirectly via contaminated surfaces.4 A reduction of the viral load on the site of infection reduces the risk of transmission via both routes while simultaneously reducing the symptoms of the patients and a potential spread of infection to the lower respiratory tract. Locally acting lozenges or sprays reach the site of infection directly, hereby minimizing potential side effects due to limited systemic uptake while maximizing efficacy.
index 1
data Lozenges containing the antiseptics and local anesthetics amylmetacresol (AMC)/dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) or hexylresorcinol (HR) are commonly used to treat the symptoms of sore throat. In 2005, Oxford et al5 published that lozenges containing AMC and DCBA showed some virucidal effect in vitro on three enveloped viruses, such as RSV, influenza A virus, and a member of the coronavirus family, SARS-CoV. However, they were not active against non-enveloped HRV2 and a not otherwise specified member of adenovirus group C. Recently, Shephard and Zybeshari6 showed some virucidal effect of AMC/DCBA and HR either as free substances or processed into lozenges on PIV3 and Cytomegalovirus or on PIV3 only, respectively. The mechanism of the virucidal action is not clear. However, the authors suggest a denaturation of external protein spikes, a pH-induced rearrangement of the tertiary structure of attachment proteins, or some selective effect on viral lipid membranes/protein–lipid interaction to be responsible for the morphological changes and the virucidal action.5,6
index 2
data An approved antiviral that interacts with the viral surface is iota-carrageenan, a high molecular weight sulfated polymer derived from the red seaweed. The antiviral activity of iota-carrageenan is well-established. We published that it is a potent inhibitor of HRV1a, 2, 8, 14, 16, and 837 and influenza virus A replication in vitro and in vivo8 and demonstrated the antiviral efficacy against common cold viruses by intranasal administration in several randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trials.9–12 In order to treat viral throat infections, we developed lozenges containing 10 mg iota-carrageenan/lozenge as an active ingredient. Ten milligrams were chosen to guarantee antiviral activity throughout the whole dissolution process in the mouth, where all the lozenges components are diluted due to saliva production.
index 3
data In this study, we tested a selection of Strepsils® lozenges containing either HR (Max [#2]) or AMC/DCBA (Original [#3], Extra Strong [#4], Warm [#5], Orange and Vitamin C [#6], Sugar free Lemon [#7], Children/Strawberry [#8] and Soothing Honey and Lemon [#9] head to head with carrageenan containg lozenges (Coldamaris®, [#1]) for their potential to inhibit viral replication of non-enveloped viruses HRV1a and HRV8 as representatives of major and minor group HRVs, and Coxsackievirus A10, which is one of the causal agents of herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Both diseases are accompanied by painful lesions in the throat predominately in children. As representatives of sore throat causing enveloped viruses, influenza virus A H1N1n and hCoV OC43 were chosen; the latter was tested using a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay.
index 4
data Next, we wanted to know whether the carrageenan liberated from the lozenge in the mouth is sufficient to guarantee antiviral activity throughout the entire dissolution process and whether this time span is sufficient to effectively reduce the titer of influenza virus A H1N1n and hCoV OC43.
index 5
data Lozenges were weighed and dissolved in 5 mL water (for pH measurements; Table 1) or medium (for assays). Vials were placed on a horizontal shaker until lozenges were dissolved. Based on the weight of the lozenge and the volume of the solvent, a concentration of the active ingredient was calculated. This resulted in an iota-carrageenan concentration of 1400 μg/mL and a concentration of DCBA, AMC, and HR of 160, 80, and 315 μg/mL, respectively.
index 6
data The human cervical epithelial carcinoma cell line (HeLa) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Sigma Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Aldrich) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic mix (Sigma Aldrich) in a 37°C incubator (Sanyo, Okayama Prefecture, Japan; CO2: 5%, relative humidity: >95%). In all experiments a medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic mix was used. HRV1a and 8 serotypes were obtained from the ATCC and grown on HeLa cells. The stocks were frozen at −80°C and virus titers were determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay.
index 7
data The human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) was purchased from the ATCC. The cells were cultivated in DMEM (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Aldrich) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic mix (Sigma Aldrich) in a 37°C incubator (Sanyo; CO2: 5%, relative humidity: >95%). A medium containing 1% antibiotic–antimycotic mix and 0% or 2% fetal bovine serum was used for infection and propagation, respectively. Human Coxsackievirus A10 was obtained from the ATCC and grown on RD cells. The stocks were frozen at −80°C and virus titers were determined by TCID50 assay.
index 8
data Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultivated as described elsewhere.13 Influenza virus A/Hansa Hamburg/01/09 (H1N1n) was kindly provided by Peter Staeheli (Department of Virology, University of Freiburg, Germany) and propagated in MDCK cells as described elsewhere.13
index 9
data Vero (embryonic African green monkey kidney) cells were purchased from the ATCC. The cells were cultivated in OptiPro serum free medium (Life Technologies Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine (Sigma Aldrich) in a 37°C incubator (CO2: 5%, relative humidity: >95%). hCoV OC43 was obtained from the ATCC and propagated in the same medium. The stocks were frozen at −80°C and virus titers were determined by TCID50 assay.
index 10
data Lozenges were dissolved with the respective assay medium. The toxicity testing was performed under the assay conditions of the respective antiviral assays. Cell survival was assessed with resazurin fluorescent dye and crystal violet (HeLa and RD cells) or crystal violet only (MDCK cells). The highest noncytotoxic concentration was used as starting point in the subsequent antiviral activity assays.
index 11
data A cell-based assay in a 96-well format was used to test the antiviral effectiveness of the different lozenges solutions against HRV1a/8 and Coxsackievirus A10. Here, the virus was preincubated with a semilogarithmic dilution series of the respective test samples or control for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT; prophylactic treatment) before it was added to HeLa/RD cells for infection. After an infection period of 30 minutes at RT, cells were washed with medium and then cultured at 33°C (HRV) or 37°C (Coxsackievirus), hereby maintaining the same concentrations of active agent as in the prophylactic treatment. The antiviral effectiveness of the test samples was assessed by determining cell viability using resazurin fluorescent dye when >90% cells of a control infection in the absence of any active agent have died. An incubation of cells with the same dilution series in the absence of viral infection was performed to monitor a potential toxicity of the treatment. To enable direct comparison of the antiviral effectiveness of the lozenges, the half maximal inhibitory dilution (ID50) value of each sample was calculated for a sigmoidal dose–response model with XLfit Excel add-in version 5.3.1. From this value, corresponding iota-carrageenan concentrations were calculated for the lozenge #1.
index 12
data The assay was performed as described elsewhere13 with small adaptations to account for the high viscosity of the lozenges solutions. In short, the virus was preincubated with a semilogarithmic dilution series of lozenges or control solutions for 30 minutes at RT (prophylactic treatment) before it was added to a monolayer of MDCK cells for infection. After an infection period of 45 minutes at RT the inoculum was removed; cells were overlaid with semiliquid carboxymethylcellulose medium and then cultured at 37°C, hereby maintaining the same concentrations of active agent as in the prophylactic treatment. Staining was performed on fixed cells using an antibody directed against the influenza virus A nucleoprotein with a horse radish peroxidase labeled detection antibody and TMB as substrate. To enable direct comparison of the antiviral effectiveness of the lozenges, the ID50 value of each sample was calculated for a sigmoidal dose–response model with XLfit Excel add-in version 5.3.1. From this value, corresponding iota-carrageenan concentrations were calculated for lozenge #1.
index 13
data The highest nonhemolytic concentration of the test solutions was used as starting point for the dilution series. On a 96-well plate, two hemagglutination units (HAU) of hCoV OC43/well were incubated with a semilogarithmic dilution series of test samples for 10 minutes at RT. A suspension of chicken red blood cells (RBC; 1%, v/v in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) was added to each well to allow hemagglutination (HA) of RBC by the virus for 1.5 hours at 4°C. At the time point of assay evaluation, control RBC in the absence of an antiviral were fully agglutinated by the virus, whereas inhibition of hemagglutination could be observed in samples treated with the test samples up to a certain dilution factor. The minimal inhibitory dilution (MID, lozenges solutions) or concentration (MIC, active ingredient, carrageenan) of each sample was noted for comparison of the antiviral effectiveness of each sample.
index 14
data Beads were purchased from Bio Science Bead Div. of Colloidal Science Solution, Inc., Rhode Island, USA, 50–180 μm Lot# L-120809-1 and adjusted to 50% (v/v) in DMEM.
index 15
data The virus working stocks (hCoV OC43 and influenza virus A H1N1n) were mixed with the iota-carrageenan bead solution to give a final bead concentration of 25% (v/v) and a HA titer of 7.5 HAU/50 μL. This corresponds to 9.43e6 hCoV OC43 and 3.03e4 influenza virus particles/well.
index 16
data The virus/bead solutions were incubated at RT to allow binding of the virus to the beads for 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes. At the indicated time points, aliquots were taken. The virus/beads complexes were removed by centrifugation immediately. The supernatant containing unbound virus was harvested and kept at RT.
index 17
data As a reference for the maximal viral load in the absence of beads, the virus working stock was adjusted with ½ the volume of DMEM to 7.5 HAU/50 μL and kept at RT. As soon as all supernatants were harvested, an HA assay was performed to determine the viral titer. To this end, a 1:1.25 serial dilution in DMEM was prepared in duplicates in a 96-well plate. A suspension of chicken RBC (0.5%, v/v in PBS) was added to each well to allow hemagglutination of RBC by the virus for 60 minutes at 4°C.
index 18
data First, the hemolytic activity of the different lozenges solutions was determined. In the case of the AMC/DCBA/HR lozenges, the applicable dilutions for the hCoV OC43 HAI assay were limited to dilutions ≥1:8 (lozenges #2, #5, #8, and #9) or ≥1:32 (lozenges #3, #4, #6, and #7) because of a hemolytic effect of the lozenges solutions on chicken erythrocytes. Carrageenan containing lozenges did not show any hemolytic effect (data not shown). From all AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges tested, only lozenge #5 (AMC/DCBA) is active against hCoV OC43 at a dilution of ≤1:27. In contrast, the limit of the activity of lozenge #1 (carrageenan) was not reached under these assay conditions, indicating that it is at least 1622-fold more effective against hCoV OC43 than the most active of the AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges (lozenge #5) and 1368- to 5474-fold more effective than the other tested AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges with an MIC of carrageenan of <0.032 μg/mL (Figure 1).
index 19
data The effectiveness of lozenges #2 (HR), #3, #4, and #5 (AMC/DCBA) was tested in comparison to lozenge #1 (carrageenan) against HRV1a and HRV8 (Table 2). All lozenges were diluted in 5 mL medium before their cytotoxicity was determined under standard assay conditions. Starting from the minimal tolerated dilution (1:16 for lozenges #1, #3, #4, and #5 and 1:50 for lozenge #2) a replication inhibition assay was performed as described in the “Materials and methods” section. Lozenge #1 is highly active against HRV1a with ID50 values of 1:496–1:1273, which correspond to iota-carrageenan concentrations between 2.8 and 1.09 μg/mL. Hence, lozenge #1 is 2-, 6.6-, and 37-fold more active than AMC/DCBA containing lozenges #3, #4, and #5, and 8.5 times more active than HR containing lozenge #2. Carrageenan containing lozenge #1 is also highly active against HRV8 with ID50 values of 1:889–1:1115, ie, at iota-carrageenan concentrations between 1.25 and 1.57 μg/mL. In contrast, none of the other tested lozenges shows any antiviral effect at the tested dilutions indicating that they were at least 22.3- to 69.7-fold less effective than lozenge #1.
index 20
data The effectiveness of lozenges #2 (HR), #3, #4, and #5 (AMC/DCBA) was tested in comparison with lozenge #1 (carrageenan) against Coxsackievirus A10. Lozenge #2, containing HR as active ingredient, was cytotoxic until a dilution of 1:25 and inactive against the virus at lower concentrations. Among the lozenges containing AMC/DCBA, only lozenge #5 showed an antiviral effect against Coxsackievirus A10 at the testable concentrations. A dilution of 1:21 caused a 50% inhibition of the virus and was thus 11.1-fold less active than lozenge #1 with an ID50 of 1:234; this corresponds to a concentration of carrageenan of 6.0 μg/mL (Table 3).
index 21
data The effectiveness of lozenges #2 (HR) and #3 (AMC/DCBA) was tested in comparison to lozenge #1 (carrageenan) which inhibits 50% of the virus replication at a dilution of 1:4524. This corresponds to an iota-carrageenan concentration of 0.31 μg/mL, whereas lozenge #3 shows the same effect when diluted only 1:9.7. Lozenge #2 did not show any antiviral activity at the tested concentrations (Table 4).
index 22
data The antiviral effect of carrageenan is conferred through direct binding of the polymer to viral particles.7 To assay the time dependency of this interaction, two representative respiratory viruses (influenza virus A H1N1n and hCoV OC43) were incubated with iota-carrageenan beads. At different time points the beads/virus complexes were separated from the solution by centrifugation; the remaining virus in the supernatant was quantified using a classical HA assay.
index 23
data Within 3 minutes, the initial viral load of 3.03e4 influenza virus and 9.43e6 hCoV OC43 particles/well is reduced by 57% and 82%; within 10 minutes by 72% and 91%, respectively. After 20 minutes, the viral load drops below the detection limit (Figure 2).
index 24
data The medium dissolution time of the lozenge in the mouth was determined to be 13 minutes and 20 seconds. During this period, the viral titer is reduced by 85% and 91% for influenza virus A and hCoV OC43, respectively.
index 25
data In 2005, Oxford et al5 described a virucidal effect on enveloped viruses (influenza A virus, RSV, and SARS coronavirus) but not on non-enveloped viruses (HRV, adenoviruses) for lozenges containing AMC/DCBA at a low pH. Currently a series of such lozenges with the same active ingredients but different flavors is available; additionally, lozenges were marketed, containing HR, as active agent. Shephard and Zybeshari6 tested the virucidal effect of AMC/DCBA and HR either as free substances or processed into lozenges. The experimental setup was the same in both publications. Lozenges were diluted in 5 or 4.5 mL artificial saliva or medium. Nine parts of the lozenges solution were then directly mixed with one part of the respective virus stock at a known titer. After different contact times, the residual infective virus was determined using quantitative titration. Oxford et al5 also checked for morphological changes using electron microscopy and found clumping of viruses and denaturation of spike proteins within 2 minutes of contact time. From these results it is concluded that lozenges containing either AMC/DCBA or HR might exhibit a local antiviral effect in patients with sore throat due to viral RTIs. However, the experimental setup does not allow the extrapolation of these data to a potential clinical effect. Dissolution of the lozenge in the mouth stimulates saliva production, resulting in a flow rate of 1.5–6 mL saliva/minute.14 As a consequence, 20–80 mL saliva were produced during the whole dissolution process of 13 minutes and 20 seconds. Therefore, the concentration of matrix and active ingredients at which the effect of the AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges was tested is 4–16 times higher than any achievable concentration in the mouth.

data Thus, we wanted to test a set of commercially available AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges using classical replication inhibition assays against a variety of representative respiratory viruses. We chose, as members of the picornavirus family (non-enveloped), HRV1a, HRV8, and Coxsackievirus A10, and influenza virus A H1N1n, as a representative of the orthomyxovirus family (enveloped). Additionally, we hypothesized that denatured spike proteins lose their ability to cause hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes. Therefore, we utilized an adapted HAI assay to determine the effect of the observed morphological changes. We chose enveloped hCoV OC43 as a representative of the coronaviruses, as they were responsible for ~20% of RTIs.3
index 27
data The AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges were tested head to head with carrageenan containing lozenges. To allow for the different lozenges to be compared directly despite their different active ingredients, instead of the conventional half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50, in replication inhibition assays) or MIC (in HAI assay) of the specific antiviral, ID50 or MIDs of the lozenges solutions were calculated.
index 28
data From all AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges tested against hCoV OC43 the following were chosen to be further evaluated in various replication inhibition assays due to the following considerations: lozenges #3 and #5 both contain AMC/DCBA as active ingredients at a similar pH, namely 2.2 and 2.3. Nonetheless, only lozenge #5 was active against hCoV OC43, wherefore it was included into the HRV and Coxsackievirus A10 experiments. To exclude the possibility that a potential antiviral activity is rather a result of the low pH than of the active ingredients, lozenge #4, with the same active agents but a pH of 5.8, was included into the test series. Lozenge #2, with a pH of 5 was tested as it is the only lozenge that contains HR.
index 29
data Different to the findings of Oxford et al,5 who did not see any virucidal effect on minor group HRV2, we found AMC/DCBA containing lozenges #3 and #4 to be slightly and highly active against minor group HRV1a, respectively. Lozenge #2, containing HR as active ingredient, was moderately antivirally active. In the case of HRV8, a member of the major group rhinoviruses, the by far largest group of rhinoviruses, we could confirm the findings of Oxford et al.5 None of the tested AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges showed any antiviral activity at the testable concentrations. In contrast, lozenge #1 was highly active against HRV1a and HRV8, with 2- to 67.9-fold superiority toward all tested other tested lozenges.
index 30
data Among the lozenges containing AMC/DCBA, only lozenge #5 showed an antiviral effect against Coxsackievirus A10 at the testable concentrations, whereas lozenge #3, with a similar pH and the same concentration of active ingredients was noneffective.
index 31
data These results indicate that neither the low pH of lozenge #5 and #3 nor the isolated effects of the active ingredients but rather one or more of the excipients/additives of the specific formulations were responsible for the antiviral effect. This is in good accordance with the results of Shephard and Zybeshari6 who found a pronounced virucidal effect of the placebo lozenges.
index 32
data As we could exclude a potential influence of the pH on the antiviral activity, we reduced the number of AMC/DCBA and HR containing lozenges to two formulations containing different active ingredients: lozenge #2 (HR) and lozenge #3 (AMC/DCBA).
index 33
data In accordance with the data published by Oxford at al5 we found some moderate activity of the AMC/DCBA containing lozenge #3 against influenza virus A. However, lozenge #1 (carrageenan) was 11.3 times more effective in inhibiting replication than lozenge #3, whereas lozenge #2 was ineffective at the testable concentrations.
index 34
data Next, we wanted to know whether the carrageenan liberated from the lozenge #1 is sufficient to guarantee antiviral activity throughout the entire dissolution process and whether this time span is sufficient to effectively reduce the titer of influenza virus A H1N1n and hCoV OC43. To this end, we studied the binding kinetics of these two viruses to iota-carrageenan beads.
index 35
data We previously utilized beads to study the mechanism of the antiviral effect of various polymers. We found that the virus binds to iota-carrageenan beads, but not to agarose beads, and that the binding can be inhibited in the presence of an excess of dissolved iota-carrageenan. Thus, it was shown that binding of virus by iota-carrageenan beads is specific and that the virus binding mechanism of iota-carrageenan is identical in its dissolved and bead-coupled form. This qualifies iota-carrageenan beads to be used as a tool for studying the time dependency of virus binding by the polymer.
index 36
data Next, we determined the average lozenge dissolution time under real conditions. Four independent test subjects dissolved a lozenge in their mouth. The timespan needed for complete dissolution was measured, and the medium time calculated from these results (13.34±2.34 minutes; data not shown). In another experiment, we found that the amount of carrageenan liberated from the lozenge is sufficient to guarantee antiviral activity throughout the entire dissolution process (873–62.1 μg/mL carrageenan, from the beginning of dissolution until the end, where almost no lozenge is left). However, it was not clear whether the average timespan that has been observed for the dissolution of a lozenge #1 is sufficient to effectively reduce the titer of representative respiratory influenza virus A H1N1n and hCoV OC43. Therefore, the binding kinetics of representative influenza virus A H1N1n and hCoV OC43 to iota-carrageenan beads was determined using an HA assay.
index 37
data In this experiment, within the first 3 minutes, the viral load was reduced by 57% and 82%, and within 10 minutes by 72% and 91% for influenza virus A H1N1n and hCoV OC43, respectively. After 20 minutes, the viral load dropped below the detection limit. The medium dissolution time of the lozenge in the mouth was determined to be 13 minutes and 20 seconds. During this period, the viral titer was reduced by 85% and 91% for influenza A and hCoV OC43, respectively.
index 38
data Taken together, the antiviral effect of the AMC/DCBA and HR containing lozenges varies widely, depending on the specific formulation of the lozenges and the the virus which causes the sore throat. This questions their suitability to be used as causative therapy in a clinical setting, where the disease causing virus mostly remains unknown. In contrast, carrageenan containing lozenges were highly active against all viruses tested, with a minimum superiority toward all other lozenges of 2- to 1368-fold for HRV1a and CoV OC43, respectively. Therefore, iota-carrageenan containing lozenges are an appropriate measure to effectively reduce the number of viral particles in the mouth. They can be used as a causative therapy against viral infections of the throat.
