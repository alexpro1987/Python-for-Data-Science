Globally, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) are among the most widely produced and used nanomaterials (NMs). The estimated global annual production of TiO2NPs is currently near 12,500 tons (1,2). This value is expected to reach 2.5 million metric tons by 2025 (3). Owing to their unique physico-chemical properties, TiO2NPs are used in diverse applications including consumer, industrial and biomedical fields. The extensive synthesis and pervasive use of TiO2NPs has resulted in unprecedented avenues for human exposure to these materials in the environment and through the use of consumer products. Exposure to TiO2NPs via inhalation leads to pulmonary inflammation, emphysema and lung injury in experimental rodents (4,5). Due to their nanosize, TiO2NPs penetrate deep into the highly vascularised areas of lungs and persist in lungs for weeks after the last exposure (6). In addition, TiO2NPs deposited in rodent lungs translocate to blood, liver, heart, lymph nodes, spleen and other organs (7–10). These results imply that exposure to TiO2NPs can negatively impact health of the organisms exposed.
Acute pulmonary responses in rodents exposed to TiO2NPs are greatly influenced by their primary particle size (11–14), surface area, surface charge, surface coatings (15–18) and their crystalline structure (19,20). These results suggest that a combination of physico-chemical properties influence the pulmonary outcome of exposure to TiO2NPs. It is yet to be determined whether one of these properties is more important than the others and whether the underlying mechanisms of the observed pulmonary responses differ by the properties of TiO2NPs.
We have previously employed toxicogenomics tools to characterise the pulmonary transcriptomic responses in mice exposed via inhalation (21) or instillation to TiO2NPs of different sizes, surface coatings and TiO2NPs embedded in paint (6). We have shown that all types of TiO2NPs induce pulmonary inflammation via the same mechanisms; however, the severity of response varies with their specific properties (22). The transcriptomic studies discussed above were limited to few TiO2NP types and for now, it is not clear whether the results from those studies can be generalised to all TiO2NP variants. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of lung toxicogenomic responses in mice exposed individually to six different types of TiO2NPs varying in size, crystalline structure and surface coatings to further our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of TiO2NP-induced lung responses. Acute, subchronic and chronic post-exposure time points were included along with a range of doses. The TiO2NP types included anatase TiO2NPs of 8, 20, and 300nm, mixed anatase/rutile TiO2NP of 20nm and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm with hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces. Mice were exposed via single intratracheal instillation to 18, 54, 162 or 486 µg/animal doses of individual TiO2NPs. Although the 486 µg/animal dose is physiologically high, it was included in the study to determine whether exposure to TiO2NPs results in lung pathology at higher doses. Samples were collected at 1, 28 and 90 days post-exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cellularity, histopathology, particle localization in lungs (by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Cytoviva nanoscale hyperspectral microscopy) were assessed at all three post-exposure time points. Global gene expression profiles were generated for all doses, at Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure time points. Pathway tools were employed to characterise the molecular pathways perturbed following exposure to TiO2NPs. Disease similarity tools were employed to determine whether the altered gene expression profiles are associated with any known lung disease.
A set of six TiO2NPs of varying physico-chemical properties were investigated in the current study (Table 1): anatase TiO2NPs of three different sizes, 8, 20 and 300nm (aTiO28,
aTiO220 and aTiO2300), mixed anatase and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm (raTiO220) and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm with hydrophilic [rTiO220 (HY)] or hydrophobic [rTiO220 (HP)] surfaces. All six particles were obtained from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development through the sponsorship program. The aTiO28 is commercially known as Hombikat UV100 and is available through Sachtleben Chemie GmbH, Germany. It is used as a semiconductor catalyst in photocatalytic applications. The aTiO220 and aTiO2300 are commercially available as PC105 and tiona, respectively, from Cristal Global (http://www.cristal.com), whereas, raTiO220 is commercially known as P25 and is available from Evonik Degussa GmbH, Germany. The rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) are known as UV Titan M262 and UV Titan M212, respectively, and are available from Sachtleben Chemie GmbH, Germany. The selected anatase TiO2NPs are used in building materials and in air purification systems for their photocatalytic activity. They are also used in self-cleaning fabrics, glass and other products. The raTiO220 NPs are commonly used as catalyst carriers, active components for photocatalytic reactions and as heat stabilizers in silicone rubber. The two functionalised TiO2NPs—rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP)—are used in skin and sun care products. The hydrophobic rTiO220 (HY) is also used in manufacturing waterproof and stain resistant textiles (23,24).
The particles aTiO28, raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) have been extensively characterised by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and reported in Rasmussen et al. (25). In brief, aTiO28 and raTiO220 are relatively pure. Negligible amount of silica (Si), aluminium (Al), and sulphur (S) was identified in aTiO28. The rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) contain 91.3% and 92.7% Ti, respectively, and are suggested to contain relatively higher levels of Al, Si, and S. In addition, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis shows the presence of dimethicone (~2 weight %) coating on rTiO220(HY) and glycerol (~1–2 weight %) on rTiO220(HP), which contribute to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature of the rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP), respectively (25). Extensive characterisations of aTiO220 and aTiO2300 have not been reported. The details of the particle characterisations are summarized in Table 1.
A pilot study was conducted to assess the dispersion of TiO2NPs in MilliQ water, 2% serum or mouse BALF. The results revealed (data not shown) that with the exception of raTiO220, all other TiO2NPs are best dispersed in MilliQ water. Thus, MilliQ water was used as particle dispersion vehicle for the experiments. For the purposes of consistency, the raTiO220 was also prepared in MilliQ water. A stock suspension of 6mL for each type of TiO2NPs at a concentration of 12.15mg/mL was made in MilliQ water. The particle suspension was dispersed by sonicating the samples using an S-450D sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT, USA) at 10% amplitude for a total of 16min on ice with alternating 10s pulses and pauses in an enclosed chamber.
The size and agglomeration state of TiO2NPs in dry state were analysed using TEM analysis (Tecnai G2 F20 FETEM, FEI, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) at the Nano Imaging Facility of Carleton University. Samples were stirred in filtered ethanol and sonicated for 5min (ultrasonic water bath). A drop of this suspension was deposited on copper TEM grids (200-mesh copper grids covered with Formvar/Carbon film (Agar Scientific, Essex, UK), air-dried and analysed using TEM.
The stock suspensions of the TiO2NPs at a concentration of 50 µg/ mL were prepared in MilliQ water and sonicated as described above. Prior to the dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis with the Nicomp 380 ZLS instrument (Nicomp Particle Sizing Systems, Santa Barbara, CA, USA), samples were manually mixed and diluted 1 in 100 with 0.22 µm-filtered MilliQ water and were sonicated again for 5min in a water bath sonicator. The DLS instrument was calibrated using 90nm and 240nm standard calibration beads, and the analysis was conducted according to the DLS manufacturers’ instructions. The value of the number-weighted particle size distribution was calculated assuming that the particles are spheres of uniform density that scatter light according to classical Mie theory (26).
Five-to-seven-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were housed in autoclaved cages with a 12-h light–dark cycle. All mice were given food and water ad libitum throughout the experiment. Animals were weighed before beginning the exposure and once every week during the course of the experiment. Mice were housed in pairs. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council for Animal Care and approved by Health Canada’s Animal Care Committee.
The particle suspensions were dispersed as described above under preparation of TiO2NP stocks section. The 486 µg/40µL stock suspensions of the TiO2NPs were diluted to obtain 18, 54, and 162 µg per 40 µL and dispersed by sonication for an additional minute. The doses 18, 54, 162 and 486 μg/mouse are equivalent to 1.5, 5, 15, and 45 working days at the Danish occupational exposure level for TiO2 (6.0mg Ti/m3~9.75mg TiO2/m3), respectively. Although physiologically high, the dose 486 µg/mouse was included in the study to determine whether TiO2NPs induce pathological changes at the higher doses. The suspensions were used immediately after the preparation. MilliQ water devoid of particles was used to expose control animals.
Each treatment group consisted of 10 animals. Mice in the experimental groups received a single intratracheal instillation of 18 µg (very low), 54 µg (low dose), 162 µg (medium dose) or 486 µg (high dose) of TiO2NPs in a 40-µL suspension prepared as described above, followed by 150 μl air with a 250 µL SGE glass syringe (250F-LT-GT, MicroLab, Aarhus, Denmark). Intratracheal instillation was performed under anaesthesia with 5% isoflurane (Isoflo, Esteve Farma, Carnaxide, Portugal) in 100% oxygen. Control mice received 40 µL of vehicle (MilliQ water) only. Following instillation, mice were kept under observation until they recovered from anaesthesia. Mice were killed on Days 1, 28 and 90 post-exposure. Blood, BALF and lung tissue were collected. One set of five experimental and five control mice were lavaged and the left lobe of lung from these mice were cut into two pieces, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in cryogenic vials at −80°C until analysis. The other set of five experimental and five control mice were not lavaged. Whole lungs from these mice were fixed in formalin (three mice/group) or glutaraldehyde (two mice/group) for histopathology and TEM analysis, respectively. Various end points investigated at the different post-exposure time points are listed in Figure 1.
The BALF cytospins were prepared as described by Poulsen et al. (27) previously. The cytospins were fixed with two sprays of Sheldon Cell Fix and air-dried and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H & E). A total of 500 cells were counted per cytospin to identify mononuclear cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes using an optical microscope (Olympus BH2, Olympus Optical Company Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). A non-parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc Tukey-type test (28) was conducted to examine the effect of doses compared with the matched control using Origin version 8 (Northampton, MA, USA). Two-way ANOVA was conducted that examined the effect of particle and dose for the three post-exposure time points. Data were analysed using the R statistical computing environment (29). The model assumptions for normality and the constant variance assumption were tested using the Anderson–Darling statistic for normality (30) and the Leven’s test for homogeneity of variance (31). However, these assumptions were not satisfied. As a result, the analysis was conducted on the ranks. As the interaction term was significant (P < 0.0001), the post hoc analysis was conducted on the pairwise comparisons. The Holm–Sidak procedure (32) was used to adjust the P values for multiple testing. The estimate and standard error was reported using the untransformed data.
Cell-free BALF supernatants were assessed for evidence of lung injury at 1- and 90-day post-exposure time points.
Commercially available β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity colorimetric assay kit (Biovision, CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In this assay, 125 µL standard synthetic p-nitrophenol derivative (pNP) or BALF were incubated for 30min at 37°C in the presence of NAG substrate, when the reaction was terminated by adding a stop solution. The release of pNP was determined by measuring the absorbance at 400nm.
Commercially available alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity fluorometric assay kit (Biovision, CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 120 µL BALF or standard ALP enzymes were incubated with 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate disodium salt (MUP) for 30min at room temperature, when the reaction was terminated by adding a stop solution. The fluorescence was measured at Ex/Em = 360nm/440nm using a fluorescence microtitre plate reader.
TEM analysis of lung tissues was conducted through the services available at the Electron Microscopy Core Laboratory, Cell Imaging and Histology Core Facility, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Canada. In brief, lung tissues from control and TiO2NP exposed (two mice/group) mice collected on Days 1, 28 or 90 post-exposure time points were perfused and fixed with 2.5 % glutaraldehyde (electron microscopy sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and 2% paraformaldehyde solution (electron microscopy sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). The fixed lung tissue samples were cut into small pieces, rinsed with 0.15M phosphate buffer and 0.15M sodium cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 2 % osmium tetroxide (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) and 0.05M potassium ferricyanide (Sigma–Aldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, ON, Canada) in 0.12M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2h. The osmofication was followed by three rinses with Milli-Q and en bloc staining with 1% uranyl acetate (Leica Microsystems, Ultrastain-1, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) in Milli-Q water overnight at 4°C. The samples were gradually dehydrated in ethanol on the following day and embedded in Epon according to the standard procedures (TAAB Laboratories Equipment, TAAB 812 resin kit, West Berkshire, UK). Embedded samples were ultrathin-sectioned on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). The resulting sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before they were visualised using TEM.
Total RNA was isolated from random sections of the left lung lobe (n = 5 per experimental group) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified using RNeasy Plus Mini kits (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), and RNA quality and integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples showed RNA integrity numbers above seven.
Total RNA (250ng) samples from individual mice (n = 5 per experimental and control group) and from Universal Mouse Reference total RNA (UMRR; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) were used to synthesise double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), which was then used to synthesise Cyanine-labelled cRNAs using Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cRNAs from experimental (control and TiO2NPs-exposed) groups were labelled with cyanine 5-CTP and reference cRNAs were labelled with cyanine 3-CTP using a T7 RNA polymerase in vitro transcription kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) and purified using RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). An equimolar amount of reference cRNA was mixed with each experimental cRNA sample and was hybridised to Agilent mouse 4×44k oligonucleotide microarrays (Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) for 17h in a hybridisation chamber at 65°C with a rotation speed of 10rpm. At the end of hybridization, arrays were scanned on an Agilent G2505B scanner according to manufacturer’s protocols (Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada). Gene expression data from the scanned images were extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5.3.1.
A reference randomised block design (33) was used to analyse microarray data, normalised using LOcally WEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) regression modelling method and statistical significance of the differentially expressed genes was determined using MicroArray ANalysis Of VAriance (MAANOVA) in R statistical software (http://www.r-project.org). The Fs statistic (34) was used to test the treatment effects compared with the matched controls exposed to vehicle only and P values were estimated by the permutation method using residual shuffling. In order to minimise any false positives, the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction (35) was applied. The fold changes of gene expression were calculated considering the least square means. Genes showing expression changes of at least 1.5-fold in either direction compared with their matched controls and showing FDR P ≤ 0.05 were considered as significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and were used in all downstream analyses. All microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI gene expression omnibus database and can be accessed via the accession number GSE81570.
Functional gene ontology (GO) analysis of the DEGs was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7. Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected GO processes, with a Fisher’s exact P ≤ 0.05 considered to be significantly enriched (over-represented). Specific biological pathways associated with the DEGs were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA). Pathways with a Fisher’s exact P value of ≤0.05 were considered for the interpretation of results.
All DEGs from the highest dose of 486 µg/mouse groups were mined against the genomic data repositories in NextBio (http://ehsrb.nextbio.com) to identify curated studies of diseases with similar gene profiles, gene ranking and consistency in fold change directionality. Pairwise gene signature correlations and rank-based enrichment statistics were employed to calculate the NextBio scores for each disease. The disease (associated with TiO2NPs exposure) that ranked the highest was given a score of 100 and the rest were normalised accordingly. The meta-analysis function in NextBio was used to compare the DEGs associated with most enriched GOs from TiO2NP-exposed lung to those reflective of lung fibrosis from the curated datasets available in NextBio.
For histopathology examinations, whole lungs from control and TiO2NP-exposed mice (n = 3) were perfused and fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated with graded alcohol and paraffin embedded prior to staining with H & E. Three mice per dose group per particle type for a total of 90 slides at each post-exposure time point were assessed. Lung sections from the 162 and 486 µg/mouse dose groups were also stained with Masson trichrome stain to assess collagen deposition. The service was carried out in the PALM Histology Core Facility, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
Since the 18 µg/animal dose showed non-significant changes in the BALF inflammatory cell profile as measured by the BALF differential cell counts and since it did not induce any observable cellular toxicity as measured by the NAG or ALP assays, this dose group was not included in the microarray experiments and is not discussed in the Results section below.
The primary particle size and morphology of aTiO28, aTiO220, aTiO2300, raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) were determined by TEM analysis. The average diameter of the majority of each particle type obtained from TEM analysis showed values close to those reported by the manufacturer, except for aTiO2300 (Table 1). Some differences in sizes and particle shapes were observed. Whereas aTiO28, raTiO220 and aTiO2300 were spherical in shape, the other TiO2NPs appeared elongated. The diameter of the cross sections ranged from 18nm to 52nm for the raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HY). The diameters of the elongated or rod shaped aTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP) were ~30nm and ~35–70nm, respectively, in the longest cross sections. Diameters of aTiO2300 were much smaller (100–120nm) than reported by the manufacturer. The size of the aTiO2300 was confirmed using nanoparticle tracking analysis (data not shown) by NanoSight LM20 (NanoSight, Amesbury, UK). All TiO2NPs were found agglomerated.
DLS analysis of the particle suspension revealed that all TiO2NPs agglomerate in water. The number-weighted particle aggregate sizes are presented in Table 1. In suspended form, the rTiO220 (HP) had the smallest particle aggregate size of 39.3±7.3nm compared with 242.9±53.1nm or 242.9±56.4nm observed for aTiO220 and raTiO220, respectively. The number-weighted particle sizes for aTiO28, aTiO2300 and rTiO220 (HY) were 148.4±38.3, 130.1±49.8nm and 110.1±27.9, respectively.
TEM analysis was used to detect TiO2NPs in the ultrastructures of the lung tissues collected on Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure. TEM images of vehicle only-exposed lung tissues did not reveal any particles on Day 1 (Supplementary Figure 1A-a and A-b) or on Day 28 (Supplementary Figure 1B-a and B-b) post-exposure. In general, all TiO2NPs were found mostly in an agglomerated state in lungs both at Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure at all the doses tested (Supplementary Figure 1 presents few representative TEM images of lungs exposed to individual TiO2NP type). The alveolar space (Supplementary Figure 1A-c, A-g and A-k), endothelium and epithelial membranes (Supplementary Figure 1A-d, A-h and A-l), macrophages (Supplementary Figure 1A-e and A-m), lamellar bodies (Supplementary Figure 1A-j), cytoplasm (Supplementary Figure 1A-i and A-n) and caveolin and near collagen fibres (Supplementary Figure 1A-f) were some of the structures of lungs where TiO2NPs were found on Day 1 post-exposure.
TiO2NPs were mainly observed in alveolar space near the microvilli (Supplementary Figure 1B-c, B-f, B-k), within the microvilli (Supplementary Figure 1B-d, B-f and B-n) and inside the vesicles (Supplementary Figure 1B-e, B-l and B-m), in samples collected on Day 28 post-exposure. At this time point, particles were mostly found in a non-agglomerated state suggesting that over time, the larger agglomerates may be breaking down.
BALF from five mice from each control and exposed groups was assessed for differential cell counts. Details of the total and differential cell counts are summarised in Figure 2 and in Supplementary Table 1. As such, no general trend in increase in total cell number was observed; however, a non-significant dose-dependent increase in the total number of cells in BALF was observed on Day 1 post-exposure for raTiO220 NPs (Figure 2A). On Day 28 post-exposure, only the rutile/anatase and rutile groups showed increased number of BALF cells at the high dose (Figure 2B).
The mononuclear cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes accounted for 98–99.7%, 0.3–1.8% and ~1.0% of the total cell population of control BALF, respectively. According to the cellular profiles shown in Figure 2A, a dose-dependent decrease in the number of mononuclear cells (Figure 2A-b) and concomitant increase in the number of neutrophils (Figure 2A-c) was observed at Day 1 post-exposure, regardless of the type of TiO2NPs. The highest increase in neutrophils was observed in mouse lungs exposed to rTiO220 (HP) (Supplementary Table 1 and Figure 2A-c). The changes in the number of lymphocytes at any dose were not significant (Figure 2A-d).
The changes in the number of mononuclear cells following exposure to rutile/anatase or rutile NPs were observed but not for the anatase NPs on Day 28 post-exposure (Figure 2B-b); a dramatic decrease in the number of BALF neutrophils was observed for all groups (Figure 2B-c). Moreover, a dose-dependent increase in the total number of lymphocytes was observed for all TiO2NP groups on Day 28 post-exposure; although only the changes at medium and high doses were significant (Figure 2B-d).
Global lung gene expression profiles derived from a total of 240 microarrays were used to assemble the data. Two main comparisons were made: (i) aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300 were compared to understand size-related effects and (ii) raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) were compared to understand the influence of surface modification. Each individual data set was analysed separately to identify the specific changes in gene expression compared with the matched vehicle controls. A list of all DEGs (upregulated and downregulated genes) on Day 1 and Day 28 following exposure to six individual types of TiO2NPs are presented in Supplementary Table 2. Figure 3A summarises the number of upregulated and downregulated genes for all doses and post-exposure time points for each particle type.
A total of 225, 105 and 85 unique DEGs (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 3a–c. The DEGs that were common to more than one dose were only counted once.) were found in the lungs of mice exposed to aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300, respectively, on Day 1 post-exposure time point. Specific to individual dose groups, aTiO28 did not have any DEGs at the low (54 µg) dose; whereas 8 (all upregulated) and 224 (185 genes upregulated and 39 downregulated) DEGs were found in the 162 and 486 µg dose groups, respectively. The most DEGs were mainly associated with the inflammatory and acute phase signalling pathways. The large fold changes were observed for members of the Serum amyloid A (Saa); Saa3 (38.0-fold), Saa2 (3.4-fold) and Saa1 (8.9-fold). The others included tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (Timp1, 10.1-fold), chemokine (C–C motif) ligand (Ccl) 2 (Ccl2, 6.3-fold), Ccl7 (6.8 fold), lipocalin 2 (Lcn2, 5.1-fold), chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand (Cxcl) 1 (Cxcl1, 4.0-fold), Cxcl10 (3.8-fold) and Cxcl5 (3.6-fold). Fewer DEGs were observed for the aTiO220 type at all doses and post-exposure time points; a total of 4, 4 and 72 upregulated and 0, 0 and 30 downregulated DEGs in the 54, 162 and 486 µg dose groups were observed, respectively, at Day 1 post-exposure. Saa3 (79.6-fold), Saa1 (10.1-fold), Timp1 (11.7-fold), Ccl2 (4.7-fold) and Lcn2 (9.0-fold) were significantly differentially expressed for aTiO220. The lungs of mice exposed to aTiO2300 showed a total of 85 unique genes differentially expressed. Among these 4, 6 and 69 DEGs were upregulated and 2, 0 and 12 were downregulated in 54, 162 and 486 µg dose groups, respectively. A large number of inflammation-associated genes including, Saa3 (71.2-fold), Saa2 (4.3-fold), Saa1 (8.4-fold), Timp1 (6.6-fold), Ccl2 (2.8-fold), Ccl7 (2.8-fold), Ccl17 (2.6-fold), Lcn2 (8.7-fold), Cxcl1 (2.1-fold), Cxcl10 (1.9-fold) and Cxcl5 (3.4-fold) were significantly expressed in mouse lungs exposed to aTiO2300 at the highest dose.
At Day 28, the response was largely reversed for all three particle types. A total of 8, 5 and 25 DEGs were (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 3d–f) found in the lungs of mice exposed to aTiO28,
aTiO220 and aTiO2300, respectively, at Day 28 post-exposure. The aTiO28 group showed 2 (upregulated) and 8 (3 upregulated and 5 downregulated) DEGs in the 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups, respectively. The aTiO220 NPs induced differential expression of 5 (3 upregulated and 2 downregulated) and 3 (2 upregulated and 1 downregulated) genes in each of the 54 and 486 µg dose groups, respectively, and none in the 162 µg dose group. Nr1d1(2-fold), Spon2 (−2.1-fold) and Nr1d1(1.9-fold) genes associated with inflammation were altered following exposure to aTiO28 and aTiO220, respectively. In the mice treated with aTiO2300, 1, 4 and 12 DEGs were upregulated and 4, 7 and 11 genes were downregulated in the 54 µg, 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups, respectively. Myl9 (1.6-fold) associated with muscle contractile activity and Hspa1a (-1.8-fold) and KFL4/KFL9 (−1.8-fold) genes associated with carcinoma were significantly perturbed following aTiO2300 exposure; none of the DEGs in the aTiO2300-exposed lungs was associated with inflammation.
In contrast to the anatase type TiO2NPs described above, the transcriptomic responses to rutile type raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) were robust. A total of 719, 104 and 354 genes were (Supplementary Table 3g–i) differentially expressed in the lungs of mice exposed to raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP), respectively, on Day 1 post-exposure. The mixed unmodified raTiO220-induced 33 DEGS (31 upregulated and 2 downregulated) in the 54 µg, 108 DEGs (84 upregulated and 24 downregulated) in the 162 µg and 714 DEGs (401 upregulated and 313 downregulated) in the 486 µg dose groups (Supplementary Table 3g–i). The rTiO220 (HY) modified with aluminum oxide and dimethicone induced fewer DEGs compared with raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP) at all the doses tested; 4, 25 and 69 genes were upregulated and 4, 15 and 35 genes were downregulated for the 54 µg, 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups (Supplementary Table 3g–i). In comparison, the rTiO220 (HP) modified with aluminum oxide and glycerol induced significantly higher number of DEGs at all three doses and post-exposure time points; a total of 70, 134 and 177 genes were upregulated and 11, 17 and 102 DEGs were downregulated on Day 1 post-exposure in the 54 µg, 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups, respectively.
At the highest dose, the genes associated with inflammation including, Saa3 (64.5, 41.6, 87.6-fold), Saa2 (5.6, 5.1, 5.4-fold), Saa1 (13.0, 5.2, 11-fold), Ccl7 (4, 4, 6.2 fold), Ccl17 (3.5, 3.5, 3-fold), Lcn2 (9.3, 5.9, 8.5-fold) and Cxcl1 (2.2, 3.8, 3.2-fold) showed the highest fold changes following exposure to raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) or rTiO220 (HP), respectively. The Ccl2 (6.3-fold) showed significant fold change following exposure to rTiO220 (HP) only. In addition, the expression of interleukin 1 receptor, type II (Il1r2, 3.3, 2.7-fold), (Il1B, 1.9, 2.2-fold), cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (Cyp7b1, 3.3, 3.4-fold) and placenta growth factor (Pgf, 2.2, 2.0-fold) responsible for fibrosis were also upregulated following exposure to raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP), respectively, and Timp1 (19.8, 5.5, 12.7-fold) and Cd14 antigen, (Cd14—1.9, 1.8, 2.3-fold) were differentially expressed in all three rutile groups, raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP) and rTiO220 (HY). Serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade E, member 1, (Serpine1, 2.6- fold) was upregulated only in the raTiO220 group.
Fewer genes were altered at Day 28 post-exposure to raTiO220 (Supplementary Table 3j); none in the 54 µg dose group, and 1 upregulated and 1 DEGs downregulated in the 162 µg group. In the 486 µg group, 9 were upregulated and 7 DEGs were downregulated. Ly6f (2.8-fold), Trem2 (2.2-fold), Nr1d2 (1.9-fold) and Spon2 (−2.3-fold) were among the genes differentially expressed at the highest dose that were associated with inflammation. Several genes were persistently altered at Day 28 following exposure to rTiO220 (HY) (Supplementary Table 3k); 3 (1 upregulated, 2 downregulated), 13 (9 upregulated, 4 downregulated) and 34 (25 upregulated, 9 downregulated) genes showed differential expression in the 54, 162 and 486 µg groups, respectively. In response to rTiO220 (HP), 9 (2 upregulated and 7 downregulated), 21 (13 upregulated and 8 downregulated) and 148 (131 upregulated and 17 downregulated) DEGS were found in the 54, 162 and 486 µg dose groups, respectively (Supplementary Table 3l). Several genes associated with inflammation and acute phase signalling were persistently altered at Day 28 following exposure to rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP). These included Saa3 (27.7 and 7.0-fold), Lcn2 (7.9 and 6.3-fold), Cxcl5 (5.4 and 5.7-fold), Ccl7 (4.0 and 5.0-fold), Cxcl1 (3.6 and 2.6-fold), Clec5a (2.5 and 2.5-fold) and Cd14 (2.1 and 1.8-fold), respectively, at the high dose. In addition, pro-fibrotic genes including Cd14 (2.1-fold), Timp1 (2.5-fold) and Cyp7b1 (2.2-fold) following rTiO220 (HY) and Ccl2 (4.1-fold), Csf2 (2.1-fold), Cd14 (1.8-fold), Adora1 (1.7-fold) and Il1rn (1.5-fold) following rTiO220 (HP) showed largest changes at the high dose.
In addition to a separate assessment of the individual data sets, a hierarchical clustering of genes differentially expressed in at least one experimental condition was conducted to determine particle, dose, or time-dependent expression patterns (Figure 3B). The analysis revealed that the expression patterns were similar for individual mice within the same treatment groups. Two main clusters were observed: Cluster-1 consisted of all doses of the five TiO2NPs for Day 28 post-exposure time point excluding raTiO220, along with Day 1 post-exposure samples of rTiO220 (HY) from the low-dose group. The Cluster-2 included Day 1 samples of all six TiO2NP types along with Day 28 post-exposure samples of raTiO220 from all dose groups and Day 28 post-exposure samples of rTiO220 (HY) from the high-dose group. The results suggested that the observed responses at the gene expression level were mainly post-exposure time-dependent and particle-specific differences were not observed (Figure 3B).
The DEGs were analysed to identify specific biological functions, processes or pathways perturbed following exposure. In agreement with the total number of DEGs, a large number of perturbed biological processes were observed in the 162 and 486 µg dose groups. The list of all biological processes affected at Day 1 post-exposure for all doses are summarised in Supplementary Table 4. Immune/inflammation responses were the top processes affected following exposure to all anatase TiO2NPs, with enrichment of GO annotations such as inflammatory response (GO:0006954), response to wounding (GO:0009611), defense response (GO:0006952), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), taxis (GO:0042330) and behaviour (GO:0007610). In addition, genes in the high-dose group of the aTiO2300 also perturbed steroid metabolic process (GO: 0008202). The largest significant changes were observed in mice exposed to aTiO28. No biological processes were significantly altered in aTiO220-exposed lungs. Two biological processes—transcription (GO:0006350) and rhythmic process (GO:0048511)—were altered in aTiO2300 group at Day 28 post-exposure. There were no significantly altered biological processes for the other two anatase types.
The microarray data were further analysed through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to understand the implications of the altered genes in lung diseases and disorders. The list of all KEGG pathways affected at Day 1 post-exposure is provided in Supplementary Table 4; the cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction (mmu04060), chemokine signalling pathway (mmu04062) and NOD-like receptor signalling (mmu04621) pathways implicated in the inflammation process were among the top pathways affected. In addition, the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (mmu00900) and p53 signalling pathway (mmu04115) were altered in response to aTiO28 and aTiO220, and extracellular matrix (ECM)–receptor interaction (mmu04512) and focal adhesion (mmu04510) were perturbed in response to aTiO28. This response was not seen in Day 28 post-exposure samples. A heat map of enriched (−log P value ≥ 1.3) canonical pathways (IPA) regulated by the DEGs at Day 1 and Day 28 are presented in Figure 4. IPA revealed unique association of DEGs in the high-dose group of aTiO220 with the p53 signalling pathway and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated signalling pathway, implying DNA damage response. The p53 signalling pathway was among the significantly perturbed KEGG pathways that was associated with DEGs of aTiO220 and aTiO28. The DEGs in the high-dose group of aTiO28 and aTiO2300 showed significant association with the pathways of hepatic fibrosis and interleukin 17 signalling in fibroblasts, suggesting a potential for these particles to induce lung fibrosis.
Only a few altered canonical pathways that included acute phase signalling, glucocorticoid receptor signalling and FXR/VDR/LXR/RXR activation were significantly perturbed on Day 28 for all three anatase TiO2NPs.
The results showed that the altered DEGs in this group are involved in inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300 induced 24, 12 and 24 DEGs associated with inflammation; 13, 4 and 8 DEGs associated with fibrosis and 2, 7 and 5 DEGs associated with oxidative stress in the 486 µg dose group (Supplementary Figure 3).These genes were no longer significantly expressed on Day 28 post-exposure.
The biological processes perturbed on Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure for all doses are summarised in Supplementary Table 5. Immune/inflammation responses were the top biological processes affected on Day 1 post-exposure, with enrichment of GO annotations, such as inflammatory response (GO:0006954), response to wounding (GO:0009611), defense response (GO:0006952), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), taxis (GO:0042330) and behaviour (GO:0007610) (Supplementary Table 5-a). DEGs in the high-dose group of the rTiO220 and rTiO220 (HY) were also associated with steroid metabolic process (GO:0008202). Processes corresponding to cell adhesion were perturbed in the high-dose raTiO220 group.
At Day 28, significant alterations in the immune/inflammation responses (Supplementary Table 5-b), which were associated with inflammatory response (GO:0006954), response to wounding (GO:0009611), defense response (GO:0006952), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), taxis (GO:0042330) and behaviour (GO:0007610) were seen only in rTiO220 (HP) group at the highest dose. raTiO220 perturbed the alteration of regulation of transcription (GO:0045449), RNA metabolism (GO:0051252), circadian rhythm (GO:0007623) and rhythmic processes (GO:0048511). No significant changes in the biological processes were observed in rTiO220 (HY) group at any dose at this late time point.
The list of all KEGG pathways affected at Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure is provided in Supplementary Table 5; the cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction (mmu04060), chemokine signalling pathway (mmu04062) and NOD-like receptor signalling (mmu04621) pathways implicated in the inflammation process were among the top pathways affected. In addition, the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (mmu00900), ECM-receptor interaction (mmu04512), focal adhesion (mmu04510) and p53 signalling pathway (mmu04115) were altered in lungs in response to raTiO220.
At Day 28 post-exposure, only rTiO220 (HP) and rTiO220 (HY) showed perturbations in the inflammatory (cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction (mmu04060) and chemokine signalling (mmu04062)) pathways. In addition, rTiO220 (HP) showed perturbations in toll-like receptor signalling pathway (mmu04620) and NOD-like receptor signalling (mmu04621) and lysosome (mmu04142) pathways.
Heat map of enriched (−log P ≥ 1.3) canonical pathways regulated by the DEGs at Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure are presented in Figure 5. The top five canonical pathways associated with DEGs on Day 1 include acute phase response signalling, agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia in pathogenesis and communication between innate and adaptive immune cells. In addition to inflammatory pathways, hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation and hepatic cholestasis were perturbed even in the low-dose groups of the rutile raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP) and in the medium- and high-dose groups of the rTiO220 (HY) at Day 1 post-exposure (Figure 4). Altered inflammatory pathways such as acute phase response signalling, agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis were also observed at Day 28 post-exposure for all rutile NPs. At this this time point, the fibrosis pathway was altered only in the high-dose group of the rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP).
The results also showed that raTiO220 induced highest number of DEGs associated with fibrotic (25 DEGs at the high dose) and oxidative stress (14 DEGs at the high dose) response categories on Day 1 (Supplementary Figure 5); however, these genes were no longer significantly expressed on Day 28 post-exposure. The rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) induced 6 and 11 DEGs associated with fibrosis on Day 1, respectively. Six of those induced by rTiO220 (HY) were also observed on Day 28. Only three DEGs were induced by rTiO220 (HP) on Day 28, which were mainly associated with inflammation.
Diseases and functions predicted from IPA showed that the diseases and functions related to inflammation were activated in lungs treated with the anatase TiO2NPs on Day 1 post-exposure (Supplementary Figure 6). In addition to diseases and functions related to inflammation, diseases and functions related to DNA damage were also activated in lungs treated with aTiO220. These diseases and functions were no longer activated on Day 28 post-exposure. In the rutile/anatase and rutile-exposed groups, the diseases and functions related to inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress were activated in the 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups (Supplementary Figure 6) on Day 1 post-exposure. These diseases and functions related to inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress were only activated in the 486 µg dose groups on Day 28 post-exposure.
DEGs from the 162 and 486 µg dose groups of all six particle types were analysed using the NextBio Human Atlas (Supplementary Table 6) to identify their potential association with known human diseases. The analysis showed that respiratory disorders, viral infectious diseases, bacterial infectious disease, parasitic disease, and nutritional and metabolic disease are among the top disease categories associated with the DEGs. The sub-categories in the respiratory disorders category included severe acute respiratory syndrome, infectious disease of lung, lower respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, injury of lung, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and fibrosis of lung.
A recently published INHAND system was used to classify lung morphology and lung lesions.(36) The H & E-stained slides were blinded for the type of TiO2NPs. The detailed lung lesion inventory is provided in Supplementary Table 7. For each lesion category, a numeric score from 0 to 5 was assigned based on a subjective assessment of the lesion severity, which corresponded to lesion not present, minimal, mild, moderate, marked and severe, respectively.
The results showed that lung sections from vehicle-treated control mice on Day 1 post-exposure are well ventilated with a few macrophages distributed diffusely in the alveolar spaces (Figure 6A–a). Infiltration of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils was observed in the treated groups in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6Ab–m). The alveolar macrophages were heavily laden with NPs. Alveolar inflammation or alveolitis was assessed by the presence of granulomatous and pyogranulomatous like structures dominated by large numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, respectively. Mild macrophage–neutrophilic alveolitis was also observed in the 162 µg dose group (Figure 6A-b–g). The degree of alveolitis in centriacinar area regions was more prominent in the 486 µg dose group for all particle types (Figure 6A-h–m).
The lung sections remained well ventilated on Day 28 post-exposure (Figure 6B-a). A dose-dependent increase in the alveolar macrophages was observed for some particle types mainly at 162 (Figure 6B-b–g) or 486 µg doses (Figure 6B-n–s); however, this change was less significant compared with the Day 1 post-exposure groups (Supplementary Table 7-b). Peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltrations of lymphocytes were observed in the 162 µg and 486 µg dose groups, except in mice exposed to aTiO2300 (Supplementary Table 7-b). Focal to multifocal granulomatous and pyogranulomatous inflammation were more pronounced in rTiO220 (HY)- and rTiO220 (HP)-exposed lungs in the 162 µg (Figure 6B-f–g) and 486 µg dose groups (Figure 6B-r–s). Lung sections were stained with Masson’s trichrome staining to assess collagen deposition on Day 28 post-exposure in the medium- and high-dose groups. Masson’s trichrome staining showed that collagen depositions were minimal in lung sections treated with TiO2NPs in the 162 µg dose groups (Figure 6B-h–m). Collagen depositions were higher in rTiO220 (HY)- and rTiO220 (HP)-exposed lungs in the 486 µg dose groups (Figure 6B-t–y) compared with other lung sections treated with other TiO2NP types.
aTiO28, raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) showed larger transcriptomic responses compared with other particle types, suggesting some TiO2NPs may be more harmful than others. Thus, a series of experiments were conducted at 90-day post-exposure to determine whether differential transcriptomics responses among the TiO2NPs eventually translates into disease manifestation for some TiO2NPs. TEM analysis of lung sections (Figure 7) showed that an appreciable fraction of TiO2NPs deposited via single intratracheal instillation were retained in lung tissues up to 90 days post-exposure regardless of the specific size or surface modifications, in the 162 and 486 µg dose groups (Figure 7-a–l). The TiO2NPs were mostly found dispersed in the cytoplasm and some were localized to phagocytic vacuoles (Figure 7-e–g). In lung sections from the aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HP)-exposed groups, particles were found inside the nuclei (Figure 7-d, 7–l).
BALF cellularity analysis revealed small increases in total cell number (Supplementary Figure 7A-a and B-a), macrophages (Supplementary Figure 7A-b and B-b) and lymphocytes (Supplementary Figure 7A-c and B-c) at 90-day post-exposure, indicating persistent but subtle inflammation. No general trends specific to particle types were observed.
To further understand the nature of the response observed at Day 90 post-exposure, cytotoxicity was assessed using β-NAG activity and ALP activity (37) in cell-free BALF supernatants collected on Day 1 and Day 90 post-exposure. Increased β-NAG activity is indicative of macrophage lysosomal activation (38). Increased ALP activity is used as a marker of (39) pathological pulmonary conditions, in which epithelial damage is a central feature of the pathogenesis, such as acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, viral pneumonia and particulate matter-induced lung toxicity (40). The results showed that the β-NAG (Supplementary Figure 8A-a and A-b) activity increased significantly on Day 1 following exposure to aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HY) at the medium and high doses and in lungs exposed to rTiO220 (HP) at the high-dose group in comparison with their matched controls. The ALP activity (Supplementary Figure 8B-a and B-b) was significantly higher on Day 1 in lungs of mice exposed to aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HP) at the medium and high doses and in lungs exposed to aTiO28and rTiO220 at the high-dose group compared with their matched controls. The increased β-NAG or ALP activities on Day 1 (Supplementary Figure 8B-a and B-b) were reduced significantly on Day 90.
In alignment with the observations above, the lung sections from the treated animals showed an increased infiltration of alveolar macrophages throughout but particularly in centriacinar area alveolar spaces at 90 Day post-exposure (Figure 8). Perivascular and peribronchiolar infiltrations of inflammatory cells were often observed irrespective of the type of TiO2NPs (Figure 8). Alveolar or septal fibroblast proliferation and granulomatous alveolar inflammation dominated by macrophages and lymphocytes were observed occasionally in treated lungs. Control mice showed only a subtle and diffuse infiltration of alveolar macrophages (Figure 8A-a–c and B-a–c). Masson’s trichrome staining for collagen revealed the presence of mild fibrosis in lungs exposed to aTiO28 (Figure 8A-j and A-p), rTiO220 (HY) (Figure 8B-k and B-q) and rTiO220 (HP) (Figure 8B-l and B-r). A mild and focal type 2 pneumocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, indicative of repair of alveolar epithelium was found only in lungs exposed to medium dose of rTiO220 (HP) (data not shown).
As stated earlier in the introduction above, it is a well-known fact that the primary particle size and the resulting surface area influence the toxicity induced by several classes of NMs including TiO2NPs. For TiO2NP variants, lung exposures leading to acute pulmonary inflammation is suggested to be predominantly dependent on size but also on several other properties such as the surface modifications. However, it is not known whether the underlying mechanisms of pulmonary inflammation are the same for all and it is also not clear whether subtle differences in the severity of acute pulmonary inflammation observed for some TiO2NP variants (22) translate into a disease phenotype at a later post-exposure time point. Thus, in the present study, we conducted a detailed assessment of lung responses to six different types of TiO2NPs with varying sizes, modifications and crystalline structures. Although the TiO2NP types investigated in the study were not synthesised in a controlled manner to vary in only one property at a time, from the results of the comprehensive assessment conducted, it can be concluded that the underlying mechanisms of acute pulmonary inflammation induced by TiO2NPs are the same regardless of their properties, which is in alignment with the previous study results published by this research group (22). Also in alignment were the results showing that while size may be the primary determinant of the toxic potential of TiO2NPs, surface modifications influence the severity of the response with hydrophilic surface being more inflammogenic compared with the other types. Halappanavar et al. (22) compared the lung transcriptomic responses in mice exposed to rutile TiO2NPs of 10nm, 38nm and 10nm TiO2NPs with hydrophilic surface and showed that at the transcriptional level, 10nm particles were more responsive with highest number of DEGs. However, surface amination of 10nm TiO2NPs resulting in hydrophilic surface increased the severity of the response (larger fold changes in inflammation-associated genes). The extensive transcriptomic profiling and histopathological analysis conducted in the present study confirm these findings. In the present study, the number of DEGs at Day 1 post-exposure to anatase-type TiO2NPs was remarkably lower for the aTiO2300 with the surface area of 10 m2/g (85 genes) and was highest for the aTiO28 exhibiting 229–235 m2/g (225 genes). While the primary particle size may have been instrumental in the lung responses induced by the anatase type TiO2NPs, for the rutile types [raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP)], mixed properties including surface modifications and crystallinity appeared to have influenced the responses. New to the present study was the finding that anatase TiO2NPs were less responsive compared with the rutile/anatase and rutile TiO2NPs at the transcriptional level. Although a direct comparison of responses induced by the anatase and rutile types was not possible as they vary in their surface properties, the overall biological response of mice exposed to anatase type TiO2NPs was less compared with the rutile ones. Previous studies have shown that crystalline structure of TiO2NPs plays an important role in toxicity induced by these particles (16,18).
Among the rutile types, all three of them were of 20nm in size and exhibited a surface area between 51 and 57 m2/g, which is relatively less compared with the surface area of anatase aTiO220 90 m2/g. It was observed that the number of DEGs induced by rTiO220 (HY) were similar to the number of DEGs induced by aTiO220; however, rTiO220 (HP) induced considerably higher number of genes at all doses and post-exposure time points compared with the other rutile and anatase TiO2NP types. These results suggest that the transcriptional responses to rutile type TiO2NPs are influenced by their surface modifications and that the hydrophilic surface positively impacts the lung responses. Although all rutile types are similar in size and surface area, mixed rutile/anatase type exhibited significantly larger transcriptomic response at the highest dose tested. The raTiO220 has been previously shown to exert higher toxicity compared with the other rutile or anatase only TiO2NPs (41–43). The higher activity of raTiO220 compared with that of either pure rutile type can be suggested to be due to the synergistic effects between rutile and anatase crystalline phases (44); however, this could not be confirmed since the present study did not include an unmodified rutile TiO2 type.
The results of the gene expression analysis were in agreement in general with the BALF cellularity and inflammatory cell infiltration. However, the BALF results were not sensitive enough to identify the subtle differences between the responses induced by the different particle types, implying that gene expression profiling may be a sensitive tool to identify property-specific toxicity attributes of particles. Although the results confirm that particle size for the unmodified and hydrophilic surface for the modified are the important properties playing a role in the toxicity induced by TiO2NPs, more studies involving TiO2NPs of a range of sizes and surface properties are required to affirm this knowledge.
The larger response of rTiO220 (HP) at the gene expression level was also reflected in the results of the histopathology showing persistent inflammation, alveolitis and granulomatous/pyogranulomatous inflammatory lesions reflective of mild fibrosis. Higher toxicity following exposure to hydrophilic rTiO220 has been shown in rats exposed via inhalation (5). Teubl et al. (45) showed that compared with rTiO220 (HY), the rTiO220 (HP) induces pronounced generation of reactive oxygen species by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential in human buccal epithelial TR146 cells (46). Surface-coated NMs are shown to exert higher toxicity compared with the pristine types; silica-coated rutile TiO2NPs elicit higher pulmonary neutrophilia, in in vivo and in vitro models (5). Rutile TiO2NPs coated with alumina or alumina/silica induce higher inflammation compared with the uncoated TiO2NPs in Sprague Dawley rats (47). In contrast to the above, a study by Warheit et al. showed that the uncoated raTiO220 are more harmful than the alumina or alumina/silica coated TiO2NPs in rats exposed by intratracheal instillation, suggesting that the crystalline structure may also be important (16,18). The latter results reflect what we have observed in this study with raTiO220 showing highest number of differentially expressed genes acutely after the exposure at the highest dose tested.
Although it was not possible to elucidate the exact reasons why hydrophilic surface renders particles more toxic, we speculate that the nature of the surface coating of the core NPs and resulting surface charge may be playing a role in determining NP–cell interactions, such as altering the cellular membrane permeability and cellular localisation upon uptake. NMs that are strongly hydrophobic in nature may non-specifically interact with the cell membrane leading to their internalisation. Preferential cellular uptake of positively charged NMs could be occurring due to the strong electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged cellular membrane (48). Studies also have shown a differential cellular localisation of the hydrophilic TiO2NPs compared with the hydrophobic TiO2NPs (49). The poor interactions with the lipid bilayer may also prolong the life of hydrophilic NPs in blood, which will allow them to reach specific sites and cause toxicity.
The different types of TiO2NPs tested in this study confirmed our previous findings (22) that initial lung responses to TiO2NPs leading to lung inflammation involves similar mechanisms, which includes activation of acute phase signalling and granulocyte and agranulocyte diapedesis pathways resulting in cytokine/chemokine storm and infiltration of neutrophils into lung fluid. However, the magnitude of the observed response was higher and persistent for rutile types and even more pronounced in rTiO220 (HP) group, suggesting that the extent of the response is property specific. Since rTiO220 (HP)-induced expression changes in few of the genes that have known association with lung fibrosis, we compared the gene expression profiles generated from the present study with the gene profiles of lungs of mice exposed to carbon nanotubes that are known to induce lung fibrosis in the same mouse model at similar doses (27,50). A direct comparison of the 69 fibrosis-associated genes described in Poulsen et al. and Snyder-Talkington et al. study (27,50), with DEGs from the present study revealed a low level of concordance with very few overlapping genes (Table 2), which included Timp1, Ccl17, Serpine1, Sod2, Plaur1, Ccl2, Il1rn, Il1b, Ctsk and C3. Considering the fact that TiO2NPs are generally viewed as inert, the subtle pro-fibrotic gene responses suggest that histopathological observations of fibrotic-like changes at the high doses (162 µg and 486 µg/animal) of TiO2NPs may still be reflecting the early phase responses to disease development and that a full manifestation of fibrosis may require recurring exposure to TiO2NPs at similar dose levels. Alveolar metaplasia has been reported in rat but not in mice following exposure to TiO2NPs in previous studies (51,52). Retention of TiO2NPs in human lung has been reported following cumulative exposures in TiO2NP production plants (53,54). In some of these human cases, exposure to rutile TiO2NPs resulted in mild subpleural fibrosis (6,55–58). However, the specific properties of the TiO2NPs that the humans were exposed to are not identified. The results of the present study suggest that the hydrophilic surface may render TiO2NPs with pro-fibrotic potential in the long term when exposed to sufficiently high doses.
Apart from the predominant inflammogenic gene expression changes, several genes associated with the p53 signalling pathway was found to be specifically altered following exposure to aTiO28 and aTiO220 NPs. TEM analysis also found particles in the nucleus following exposure to aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HP). These results suggest that some of them may have a potential to induce DNA damage. There are not many in vivo studies that have investigated the DNA damage potential of TiO2NPs. It was shown that a 21-nm anatase/rutile (59) and a 33-nm aTiO2NPs (60) induce DNA damage and genetic instability in blood cells of mice exposed orally over a short period of time. Intragastric administration of 75nm aTiO2NPs to male Sprague Dawley rats for 30 days (4) was shown to induce genotoxic effects in the bone marrow. However, positive genotoxic effects have not been observed in rodent lungs exposed to TiO2NPs via inhalation (61,62). Although many studies have investigated the genotoxic effects of TiO2NPs using in vitro models, the results are not consistent. For example, AMES assays showed no increases in the mutagenic potential of aTiO2NPs in vitro models. However, DNA damage analysis using comet assays showed that uncoated 20–50nm aTiO2NPs tested at a concentration of 100 µg/mL induced DNA breaks in BEAS2B cells, bottlenose dolphin leucocytes, human gastric adenocarcinoma cells, human epidermal cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (6,55–57). One other study showed positive DNA damage potential of 33nm aTiO2NPs in bone marrow and liver of CBAB6F1 mice exposed via gavage (60). However, at present, the properties of TiO2NPs or factors responsible for their DNA damaging potential are not understood.
In conclusion, a comprehensive assessment of lung responses was conducted following exposure to six types of TiO2NPs exhibiting differences in size, crystalline structure and surface modifications across a range of doses and post-exposure time points. The results confirmed our previous findings that the underlying mechanisms leading to TiO2NP-induced lung inflammation acutely after exposure are the same regardless of their properties; however, the results suggested that the long-term pathological effects may be influenced by their specific properties such as crystallinity and surface modifications. Specifically, from the six types tested, a combination of properties such as rutile structure and hydrophilic surface can be deemed as pathologically more active compared to other types. Although TiO2NPs are generally regarded as inert, the results from the study suggest that unfavourable and chronic exposures to very high doses of certain TiO2NP types may result in tissue injury and initiate pro-fibrotic changes in lungs over a long period of time.

Adenovirus (ADV) is one of the most common respiratory pathogens in childhood, and 13-17% of children hospitalized with a viral respiratory tract infection are diagnosed with an ADV infection [123]. Although most cases are self-limiting [34], ADV infection can lead to more severe complications and death. Specific serotypes of the ADV (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 21, and 55), a younger age (less than one year), and immunocompromised hosts have been reported as risk factors for severe ADV infection [567891011].
Recently, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which are more sensitive and cost-effective than conventional antigen detection and culture methods, have been used for diagnosing respiratory viral infections [1213]. More cases of multiple respiratory viral infections have been diagnosed using these multiplex PCR tests than were reported before using conventional testing methods [121314]. Consequently, the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfections, especially coinfection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), has been evaluated since the 2000s [15]. In a recently published meta-analysis, respiratory viral coinfections were not reported to result in a significant increase in the clinical severity of respiratory infections compared with single viral infections [15]. However, their clinical effects vary depending on the coinfected viruses and the subjects enrolled in each study. Therefore, while respiratory viral coinfections reportedly manifest as more severe illnesses in some studies [1617], other investigators report a lack of association between viral coinfection and disease severity in ADV infected children [18]. Furthermore, even as ADV infection occurs steadily all year round in Korea, the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfection on childhood ADV infection has rarely been reported [19]. In addition, previous studies on ADV coinfections included only children younger than 1 or 3 years of age, or children with lower respiratory tract infections [182021]. This retrospective study was performed to investigate the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfections in Korean children with ADV infection.
The medical records of children (below 20 years of age) admitted to the Department of Pediatrics at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, and diagnosed with ADV infection between January 2012 and December 2014, were retrospectively reviewed. Children with immunocompromised status (e.g., underlying hematological malignancy, bone marrow failure syndrome, or an autoimmune disorder requiring immunosuppressant therapy) were excluded. The enrolled children were divided into two groups based on the result of multiplex PCR test for common respiratory viruses. The ADV group included children infected by only ADV, whilst the coinfection group included children concurrently infected with two or more viruses including ADV.
data Demographic data included age and sex. Clinical data included birth history, the presence of siblings, the presence of underlying medical conditions, duration of fever and hospitalization, presenting symptoms on admission, final diagnosis on discharge, and severity of the ADV infection. Fever was defined when the tympanic membrane temperature was ≥38.0 ºC. Among presenting symptoms, respiratory symptoms included cough, rhinorrhea, sputum, nasal stuffiness and dyspnea, and gastrointestinal symptoms included vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Ophthalmologic symptoms included conjunctival injection, ocular pruritus, ocular pain and eye discharges. Neurologic symptoms included dizziness, headache and seizure-like motion, and dermatologic symptoms included various types of skin rashes. The ADV infection was considered severe in cases where oxygen therapy was given; the demand for oxygen increased in a child who had already received oxygen therapy; a child was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU); or a child died due to the ADV infection. On admission, blood tests were performed to assess total and differential white blood cell counts and platelet counts. In addition, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase levels were also assessed at admission. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were compared between the two children groups. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital (Approval No.: KC15RISI0767). Informed consent was waived for this study.
On admission, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected from children complaining of respiratory symptoms or fever without a focus. Samples were sent, as soon as possible, to the Department of Laboratory Medicine where a multiplex PCR test for respiratory viruses was conducted. The commercially available AdvanSure™ RV real-time PCR kit (LG Life Sciences Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was used to detect ADV, influenza A and B viruses, RSV, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and human bocavirus. A positive PCR result for ADV confirmed an ADV infection. If the PCR result was positive for only ADV, the child was assigned to the ADV group, and if the PCR result was positive for two or more viruses including ADV, the child was assigned to the coinfection group.
Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) included acute pharyngitis, pharyngoconjunctival fever, and acute otitis media, while lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) included acute bronchiolitis, acute bronchitis, and pneumonia.
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical variables between the two study groups were compared using a chi-square test, and continuous variables were compared using a Mann-Whitney test. Factors identified as significantly different between the ADV and coinfection groups in a univariate analysis were assessed for association with coinfection through a multivariate analysis using a binary logistic regression test. A P value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
In total, 105 children were diagnosed with an ADV infection during the study period. The median age at enrollment was 29 months (range: 0-131 months), and 60 (57.1%) children were males. On admission, 104 (99.0%) children complained of fever, and the fever persisted for a median of 5 days (range: 0-13 days) [starting 3 days (range: 0-10 days) before admission and persisting until 2 days (range: 0-5 days) after admission]. Among the local symptoms presented on admission, respiratory symptoms (87 children, 82.9%) were the most frequent, followed by gastrointestinal (24 children, 22.9%) and ophthalmologic (18 children, 17.1%) symptoms. Among gastrointestinal symptoms, diarrhea (17 children, 70.8%) was most frequent, and vomiting (11 children, 45.8%) and abdominal pain (7 children, 29.2%) followed. Febrile seizures occurred in four (3.8%) children. Five children (4.8%) showed fever without localizing signs. URTI and LRTI were diagnosed in 56 (53.3%), and 32 (30.5%) children, respectively. Thirteen (12.4%) children had underlying medical conditions. Eleven (10.5%) children were born prematurely and eight (7.6%) of them also had a previous history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD); one child had an underlying congenital hypotonia and had experienced recurrent pneumonia since birth; and one child received corrective surgery for esophageal atresia and experienced recurrent respiratory tract infections since the surgery.
Five (4.8%) of the children enrolled in the present study received oxygen therapy, one (1.4%) child in the ADV group and four (12.5%) children in the coinfection group. The child in the ADV group was diagnosed during hospitalization for preterm birth and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). He was admitted to the neonatal ICU at birth, received ventilator care and surfactant replacement therapy, and was extubated on hospital day 6. However, fever and apnea developed on hospital day 25, and he received ventilator care again. ADV infection was diagnosed at this time, and he was extubated on hospital day 36. The four children in the coinfection group received oxygen therapy for less than 3 days: two children were born prematurely and had a history of BPD, one child had underlying congenital hypotonia, and the remaining one child was previously healthy.
Thirty-two (30.5%) children were included in the coinfection group (Table 1). Of these, two viruses were simultaneously identified in 28 children (26.7%), and three viruses were simultaneously identified in 4 children (3.8%): ADV, rhinovirus and influenza B virus in one, ADV, rhinovirus and coronavirus in another, and ADV, rhinovirus and human bocavirus in the others. Rhinovirus (n = 15, 41.7%) and RSV (n = 7, 19.4%) were the most commonly coinfected viruses (Table 1).
The proportion of children younger than 24 months was significantly higher in the coinfection group compared with the ADV group (P <0.001, Table 2). The children in the coinfection group had a significantly higher tendency for underlying medical conditions (P = 0.020), LRTI (P = 0.011), and need for oxygen therapy (P = 0.029), compared with children in the ADV group (Table 2). However, the duration of fever and hospitalization was not significantly different between the two groups (Table 2). Among laboratory test results, only absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) showed a significant difference between the two study groups (Table 3). The ESR and CRP levels were lower in the coinfection group than in the ADV group; however, this difference was not statistically significant (Table 3). In a multivariate analysis, only the younger age was significantly associated with respiratory viral coinfection (P <0.001, Table 4).
As rhinovirus and RSV were the most common coinfected viruses, the ADV group was also compared with the ADV and rhinovirus coinfection group and the ADV and RSV coinfection group (Table 2). Children in the ADV and rhinovirus coinfection group tended to be younger and have more underlying medical conditions, and LRTIs compared with those in the ADV group; however, they did not receive more oxygen therapy. Similarly, children in the ADV and RSV coinfection group also tended to be younger, have more underlying medical conditions, and receive more oxygen therapy compared with those in the ADV group; however, the proportion of children with LRTIs was not significantly different between the two coinfection groups.
In the present study, clinical and laboratory characteristics of ADV infection in children were investigated, and the clinical impact of respiratory viral coinfection was determined. Respiratory viral coinfection caused more LRTI and a higher need for oxygen therapy than ADV single infection. However, coinfection did not lead to mortality, and the duration of fever and hospitalization was not significantly different between ADV and coinfection groups.
ADV infection in the present study occurred at a median age of 29 months, and in agreement with previous reports, occurred more frequently in males than in females [39192223]. All children except one complained of fever on admission, with fever lasting for a median of 6 days, as is consistent with published reports [34192223]. Respiratory symptoms were most frequent, followed by gastrointestinal symptoms, and this was comparable with previous data [222324]. In the present study, ADV caused more URTIs than LRTIs, even as the current literature provides contradictory evidences, with some reporting a predominance of URTIs [42526], whilst others report a predominance of LRTIs [2324].
Respiratory viral coinfections have been identified in 1.8% - 49.2% of respiratory tract infections in previous studies [1214202728]. The variability in the reported coinfection frequency could be due to the methods of viral detection, the number of detectable viruses, the characteristics of enrolled patients, the frequencies of underlying disorders, the seasons when the studies were performed, and the inclusion or exclusion of URTI [1428]. Most studies reported a higher frequency of respiratory viral coinfection in younger children than in older children and adults [12142728]. This presumably was caused by immature immune systems, the lack of protective immunity arising from prior exposures to viruses, and prolonged excretion of respiratory viruses in younger children compared with older children and adults [142128]. Although respiratory viral coinfection increased the rate and duration of hospitalization [141727], it eventually did not cause a poorer prognosis such as oxygen supplementation and ICU admission, compared with single viral infection [1727]. In a recent meta-analysis, the overall effect of respiratory viral coinfections on the disease severity and prognosis was not significant [15].
In the present study, respiratory viral coinfection was identified in 30.5% of the enrolled children with ADV infection. This coinfection frequency was within the reported range (9.4 - 69.6%) [41922]. Rhinovirus was the most commonly coinfected virus in the present study with RSV being the second, and this was in concurrence with prior published reports [192228].
Previous studies have reported significant association between younger age and coinfection in ADV infection, as is the case with other respiratory viral infections [18192122], and the present study also showed a significant increase in coinfection frequency in children younger than 24 months of age than that in older children. In addition, the increased LRTI cases we report in the coinfection group have been reported previously [1924]. In the present study, we observed a significant association between the presence of underlying medical conditions and coinfection, although this has not been a significant coinfection associated factor in some other previous studies [1822]. Eleven of 13 children with underlying medical conditions in the present study had a preterm birth history, and eight of them had a previous history of BPD. These medical conditions may affect the lower respiratory tract function during infancy and early childhood. Amongst younger age, LRTI, and underlying medical conditions, factors related to coinfection based on a univariate analysis, only the younger age was associated independently with coinfection following a logistic regression test.
Respiratory viral coinfection in ADV infection may cause prolonged hospitalization with or without increase in disease severity, represented by oxygen supplementation and ICU admission [172021]. Some other investigators have, on the other hand, reported no significant effect of coinfection on the duration of hospitalization and disease severity [1822]. In the present study, coinfection caused more LRTIs compared with ADV single infection, and therefore, manifested as more clinically severe and progressive disease than ADV single infection. In addition, oxygen therapy was administered more frequently in the coinfection group, especially in children coinfected with ADV and RSV, than in the ADV group. However, the oxygen supplementation duration in the coinfection group was less than 3 days, and there was no ICU admission and mortality in this group. Furthermore, the duration of hospitalization and fever was not significantly different between the coinfection and ADV groups. This suggested that even as respiratory viral coinfection may contribute to increased disease severity in children with ADV infection, appropriate treatment for such a condition can prevent further disease progression and poor prognosis.
The present study had several limitations, its retrospective nature being the first. We did not identify infecting ADV serotypes in our study, and the severity of ADV infection, as well as frequency of respiratory viral infection, varied according to the causative serotype [891011]. To evaluate the impact of specific ADV serotypes on clinical severity and frequency of coinfections, a multicenter study, involving several geographically-separated hospitals would need to be conducted for a sufficiently long period to capture multiple ADV outbreaks with different causative serotypes. Attending daycare centers may further increase the risk of exposure to a variety of respiratory viruses, and influence the frequency and severity of respiratory viral infections; however, this was not evaluated in the present study. We also could not determine the independent effect of each respiratory virus concurrently identified with ADV infection because of the small group size for each respiratory virus. Finally, the impact of coinfection on the long-term sequelae of ADV infection (e.g., bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans) could not be assessed [2930].
In conclusion, respiratory viral coinfection in children with ADV infection occurred more frequently in children younger than 24 months of age compared with children aged 24 months or older, and respiratory viral coinfection increased the proportion of LRTI and oxygen therapy requirement. However, appropriate therapy prevented prolonged hospitalization and poor prognosis due to coinfection. Clinicians should thus be more mindful of younger children diagnosed with ADV infection, and be aware of possible coinfections and faster disease progression.
In 1950, Professor Ling‐Chao Tsien () was ushered into a warehouse of the former Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) government Broadcasting Company in Nanjing, where he unpacked a cargo container full of unassembled parts of a transmission electron microscope (TEM). These TEM parts, manufactured by the British company Metropolitan‐Vickers, were purchased and hastily left behind by the fleeing Kuomintang government on its way to Taiwan. Professor Tsien was so excited about the serendipitous finding that he immediately decided to assemble the microscope despite lack of an installation handbook. In no more than 4 years, he and his co‐workers published the first electron microscopy (EM) research article in China,1 in which they described the fine structural defects of aluminum foil. This article marked the beginning of an era in China that relied on EM to examine the world at nanoscale. Application of EM soon became popular in China, especially due to its powerful utility in the characterization of inorganic materials for the steel and engineering industry.
A number of pioneering scientists in materials science and physics have made notable contributions to the development of China's EM community. Beginning in the 1980s, a few leading electron microscopists in inorganic material research, including Ling‐Chao Tsien, Ke‐Hsin Kuo (), Fanghua Li (), Duan Feng (), and Renhui Wang (), realized the huge potential of high‐resolution EM in life sciences (Fig. 1). They invited foreign scientists in the field of cryo‐EM to visit China and give lectures and workshops to young students and encouraged the younger generation to devote themselves into cryo‐EM of biological application. Nowadays, more than two‐thirds of the established Chinese scientists in the field of cryo‐EM were directly trained or largely influenced by these pioneers (Fig. 1).
At about the same period, a few young Chinese scientists from biology or biophysics launched their own expedition into cryo‐EM as the technology was developed in its premature phase. In the late 1970s, Jin‐Ju Chang () joined Jacques Dubochet's group at European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and became one of the very first few scientists studying frozen‐hydrated biological specimens using TEM.2, 3 Yun Li ()—working with Kevin Leonard at EMBL in 1980—studied mitochondria cytochrome c1 reductase complex in its single particle state using negative‐staining EM.4 Naiqian Cheng ()—working with James Deatherage at the University of Arizona—was among the first group of scientists studying the ordered insect muscle fibers using TEM.5 Da‐Neng Wang () joined Werner Kuhlbrandt's lab at EMBL and solved the first atomic structure of light harvesting complex II in its 2D crystalline forms by electron crystallography.6 Wei Xu () studied the bacteriophage prohead using cryo‐EM at Purdue University with Timothy Baker.7
In the 1990s, a few research groups in China began to explore the application of EM in structure determination of biological macromolecules. Sen‐Fang Sui () at Tsinghua University led a small group of students to grow two‐dimensional crystals of proteins on lipid monolayers8 and studied their structures and interactions with membranes using TEM.9, 10 Wei Xu at the Institute of Biophysics (IBP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) investigated two‐dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Jing‐Qiang Zhang () at Sun Yat‐sen University and Qi‐Bin Yang () at Xiangtan University examined virus structures using cryo‐EM technology. Ke‐Hsin Kuo and Fanghua Li also dedicated a portion of their limited research funds to the development and application of cryo‐EM in addition to their major focus on materials science TEM. Facing meager research funding and the lack of high‐end instruments, these groups managed to build their own hardware and software tools for their pioneering research, published several cryo‐EM papers to report research carried out solely in China, and trained the first batch of graduate students. Many of these students, exemplified by Yifan Cheng (), later became successful scientists in the cryo‐EM field (Fig. 1).
Since the year 2000, China has invested more resources in upgrading EM facilities and funding research projects in universities and research institutes. Well‐trained young scientists returned to China from a few leading cryo‐EM laboratories in the world and began their independent research careers at Tsinghua University, Peking University, Sun Yat‐sen University, University of Science and Technology of China, IBP of CAS, National Institute of Biological Sciences (NIBS), Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, and other academic institutions. The cryo‐EM research community gradually matured, bringing worldwide attention to rapid cryo‐EM development in China. In 2008, the First Kuo KH International Symposium of Cryo‐EM, co‐chaired by Da‐Neng Wang and Sen‐Fang Sui, was held successfully at Tsinghua University with more than 150 participants from all over the world. This event formally marked the beginning of a rapid rise of the cryo‐EM community in China. Since then, the Kuo KH International Symposium has become one of the most popular cryo‐EM meetings in the world.
Between November 2002 and July 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic swept throughout the greater China region, with more than 8000 confirmed cases worldwide and a death toll of 672 in Hong Kong and mainland China. China was apparently unprepared for such a traumatic experience as the general public deserted shops and avoided gathering. During the process of identifying the disease causing agent and clinical treatment, the Chinese government keenly realized the importance of basic research in biology and medicine. In 2005, Zihe Rao (), then Director of the IBP, and Fuchu He (), then Vice‐President of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences (CAMMS) successfully lobbied the government to invest on basic research through construction of a centralized biological research facility. The Chinese Commission of Development and Reform, a de facto funding agency, decided to allocate 1.1 billion Chinese Yuan (about 130 million US Dollars then) on a National Protein Science Facility (the Facility). The original idea was to build a state‐of‐the‐art facility at IBP of CAS in Beijing, which scientists from China and all over the world would use for their cutting‐edge research. Due to the construction of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and other reasons, the leadership of CAS changed their mind in 2006 and proposed to build the Facility in Shanghai instead of Beijing. This change caused an uproar among scientists in Beijing, particularly those at CAMMS and Tsinghua.
To retain the Facility in Beijing, Fuchu He approached Yigong Shi (), who had just began the relocation of his laboratory from Princeton to Beijing, and Zhixin Wang (), who joined the Tsinghua faculty after serving as the Director of IBP from 1999 to 2003. Together, Wang and Shi convinced the administration of Tsinghua University about the importance of retaining the Facility in Beijing, perhaps to a location conveniently accessible by scientists from Zhongguancun () and neighboring institutions. With strong support from the Ministry of Education and Beijing municipal government, Tsinghua University formed an alliance with CAMMS to compete with CAS for the right to build the Facility in Beijing instead of Shanghai. After several rounds of discussion, the final outcome was a compromised solution: the Chinese Commission of Development and Reform decided to split the funds evenly between Tsinghua/CAMMS and CAS in 2008. CAS would spend its share of 550 million Yuan on a facility in Shanghai (Shanghai Facility), located next to the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in the Pudong District. The Shanghai Facility received an additional allocation of approximately 200 million Yuan from the local government.
The decision to split the Facility between two distant locations proved to be correct, because scientists in each location faced the competitive pressure to achieve higher scientific productivity and originality. In addition, the local governments competed to provide more financial support. The Beijing municipal government was more generous, providing 1:1 matching funds to the allotment from the central government and making the total investment 1.1 billion Chinese Yuan. Once the solution was reached between Tsinghua/CAMMS and CAS, Peking University and IBP asked to have a share of the Beijing Facility. It took some time for all parties to agree to a negotiated consensus. In the end, CAMMS had half of the total funds, with Tsinghua and Peking Universities splitting the remaining half. Despite its affiliation with CAS, IBP also received a small share of the funds that were earmarked for research instrument development. In the end, the Beijing Facility, also known as the Pilot Hub of Encyclopedic ProteomIX (PHOENIX), consists of three sites: a main location at CAMMS that focuses on proteomics, an arm on biological EM at Tsinghua, and a second arm on biological nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at Peking University. Binglin Gu (), a former President of Tsinghua University, vividly described the Beijing Facility as “one body and two wings,” or “,” where the body refers to CAMMS and two wings Tsinghua and Peking Universities.
Assignment of the biological EM arm to Tsinghua University was anything but a random choice. At the beginning of the millennium, hard X‐ray free‐electron laser (XFEL) technology began to show promise as a powerful tool for structural elucidation of macromolecules. A large number of scientists from several disciplines had been lobbying the Chinese government for the construction of a national XFEL facility. Unfortunately, even under optimal circumstances, such an XFEL facility would be completed for operation no earlier than the year 2025 and thus offered little help to the ever‐increasing demands of structural biologists in China. Nonetheless, the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility—a third‐generation light source—was under construction in 2006, and Peking University had already built a national NMR facility with support from several branches of the central government. Thus, despite booming structural biology in China, complete absence of any high‐end TEM with field‐emission gun (FEG) for biological EM in 2007 formed a sharp contrast to the other two major methods of structure determination. Importantly, EM‐based methodologies—including single‐particle cryo‐EM, cryo‐electron tomography (cryo‐ET), and electron crystallography—had begun to show remarkable potential. In early 2007, a consensus was quickly reached among key scientists at Tsinghua—particularly Shi, Sui, and Wang—to build a centralized EM facility at Tsinghua. The University administration fully supported the decision. On behalf of Tsinghua, Sui delivered a proposal for such a facility to members of a review panel in May 2007.
The Tsinghua Facility now has three Titan Krios, one Tecnai Arctica, one Tecnai F20, and three Tecnai Spirit TEMs (Table 1). All microscopes are fully operational. One of the three Titan Krios (Titan1) is equipped with a K2 Summit direct electron detector, and the other two Titan Krios (Titan2 and Titan3) will have their K2 detectors installed by Fall 2016. In addition, Titan2 has an energy filter, and Titan3 will have the most complete auxiliary components including an energy filter, an image Cs‐corrector, and a phase plate. The facility also has an FIB/SEM dual‐beam system equipped with a cryo‐SEM preparation workstation and a correlative light electron microscopy workflow. In addition to the microscopes, the facility has a complete set of cryo‐EM sample preparation equipment including high‐pressure freezers, freeze substitution systems, ultramicrotomes, freeze plungers, plasma cleaners, and high‐vacuum evaporators. An accompanying computing facility of 10,000 CPU cores and 10 PB storage has been installed and will be further expanded.
The most important prerequisite for building a world‐class EM facility is to recruit top‐notch scientists. Coincidentally, three young scientists Haixiao Gao (), Jianlin Lei (), and Ning Gao (), all from the laboratory of Joachim Frank then at Wadsworth, wrote to Sui and Shi in May 2007, expressing a strong desire to build a unified laboratory at Tsinghua University. Jianlin Lei, trained in physics at both undergraduate and PhD levels, has strengths in EM instrumentation and methodology. Ning Gao has rich experience with protein biochemistry and EM sample preparation. Haixiao Gao had received comprehensive training in cryo‐EM and was the leader of the trio. Shi interviewed the team in Room 418 of the Schultz Laboratory at Princeton University, where Haixiao Gao gave an impressive presentation on behalf of all three. As the only interviewer, Shi was convinced of the ambitious EM‐based research plan presented by Gao and formally invited the three to apply for tenure‐track faculty positions at Tsinghua University. After a prearranged interview, the three were simultaneously offered independent positions, with ample start‐up funds.
Haixiao Gao included a Titan Krios microscope as a must‐have item on her list of requirements. The price tag of approximately 4 to 5 million US dollars, or approximately 35 million Chinese Yuan, was an astronomical number to Tsinghua University. With strong support from Zhixin Wang and Sen‐Fang Sui, Shi turned to the Tsinghua University administration for help in early May 2008. The possibility of installing Asia's first operational Titan Krios on Tsinghua campus and the huge research potential convinced the leadership, which decided to make an investment of 30 million Yuan after listening to a brief presentation by Shi. These funds were supposed to cover both the purchase, room preparation, and the operation of the Titan microscope. Facing a gap of funds, Shi et al. had to negotiate with FEI to lower the purchase price. Gratifyingly, within 2 weeks of the very first meeting with the FEI team, Shi signed a formal Titan Krios purchasing contract on behalf of Tsinghua University in June 2008. This Titan Krios microscope (Titan1) arrived in early March 2009 and became fully operational in June, the first in Asia.
To fully utilize the first Titan Krios microscope in China and Asia, Tsinghua decided to recruit additional faculty members in cryo‐EM. Hong‐Wei Wang () performed his PhD thesis research on cryo‐EM in the laboratory of Sen‐Fang Sui and received his postdoctoral training with Eva Nogales at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Wang received several excellent job offers including one from Tsinghua in 2008 but chose to begin his independent career at Yale University instead. Convinced by Shi of the once‐in‐a‐lifetime opportunity to build a world‐class cryo‐EM facility, Wang returned to Tsinghua in 2011 and quickly became a major driving force behind Tsinghua's continued effort of hiring EM faculty members and expanding the EM facility. Ye Xiang (), a postdoctoral scientist with Michael Rossmann at Purdue University, was recruited to Tsinghua in 2013. Xueming Li (), a postdoctoral fellow with Yifan Cheng at UCSF and an inventor of the semiautomated low‐dose acquisition program UCSF‐Image4 and the motion correction program MotionCorr,11 joined Tsinghua in 2014. Jiawei Wang (), a classically trained X‐ray crystallographer, shifted his research focus to EM data analysis. A critical mass on EM methodology and application began to take shape at Tsinghua. Such a build‐up would have been flawless if it were not for the unexpected and sudden departure of Haixiao Gao at the beginning of 2010.
The emergence of direct electron detectors has fundamentally changed the impact of EM on the various biological research fields. Soon after the operation of Titan1 at Tsinghua, IBP and the Shanghai Facility installed their own 300 kV Titan Krios microscopes, each recently upgraded with a K2 direct electron detector (Table 1). The bright prospects of EM‐based research spread rapidly in China, with a number of institutions quickly committed to the purchase of 300 kV cryo‐TEMs. These institutions include Fudan University and Shanghai Tech University in Shanghai, Peking University, Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, Sichuan University in Chengdu, Wuhan University, Xiamen University, Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, and the Institute of Pathogen Biology of CAS (Table 1). IBP has recently ordered a second Titan Krios microscope. In most places, accompanying microscopes operating at 200 kV and/or 120 kV have also been planned. A number of other institutions have already purchased or plan to purchase a 200 kV cryo‐TEM and are keen to the possibility of purchasing a 300 kV cryo‐TEM. Currently, there are seven TEMs operating at 300 kV in mainland China, of which five are Titan Krios (Table 1). The number of Titan Krios and equivalent 300 kV microscopes in operation is likely to reach double digits in China by the end of 2017, when the total number of operational cryo‐TEMs will exceed 50.
Xueming Li had worked on EM for materials science in his early career. In 2009, he changed his research field to structural biology with the specific aims of improving the efficiency and resolution of biological cryo‐EM. Obtaining a large number of particles to boost the overall signal‐to‐noise ratio and enhancing signal recording efficiency at high frequency are two key strategies for achieving atomic resolutions in cryo‐EM. As a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Yifan Cheng at UCSF, Li introduced the general purpose graphic processing unit (GPGPU) into 3D reconstruction17 and developed the data collection system named UCSFImage.11 These efforts resulted in the acceleration of single‐particle cryo‐EM data processing by more than 10‐fold. His studies on a new generation of detector (i.e., electron counting camera), and a new motion correction procedure, greatly facilitate cryo‐EM reconstruction of small biomolecules at near atomic resolution.18, 19 Since joining Tsinghua University in the spring of 2014, Li has focused on the development of new methods and technologies, aiming to make atomic‐resolution cryo‐EM analysis more accessible and convenient for a wide range of biological samples. Relying on the deep learning algorithm, Li and his collaborators, Jianyang Zeng () and Tian Xia (), have developed a fully automated particle‐picking program (Table 2).20
Fei Sun () of IBP has been collaborating with Fa Zhang () of the Institute of Computation Technology, CAS, to build an automatic pipeline for high‐resolution electron tomography (ET). They developed a feature‐based tilt series alignment algorithm ATOM_align21 for plastic section ET and a fiducial marker‐based tilt series algorithm MarkerAuto22 for cryo‐ET. To improve the contrast and quality of ET reconstruction, they developed three different reconstruction algorithms: ASART,23 FIRT,24 and ICON.25 Notably, ICON combines both nonuniform fast Fourier transformation and compressed sensing techniques and significantly recovers the missing information in both the angular intervals and the missing wedge.
The organization and dynamics of the 30 nm chromatin fiber play a critical role in regulating DNA accessibility for gene transcription. Ping Zhu () of IBP started his cryo‐EM training as a postdoctoral fellow at Florida State University in 1999. He had been working on the structures of envelope glycoproteins (ENV) on the surface of AIDS viruses26, 27 before returning to IBP. Primarily using cryo‐EM, Zhu seeks to understand the molecular mechanism of viral assembly, infection, and replication, and the higher order structure of 30 nm chromatin fiber. Zhu et al. determined the cryo‐EM structure of 30 nm chromatin fiber reconstituted from 12 nucleosome arrays at a resolution of 11 Å (Table 2)28. The in vitro reconstituted 30 nm chromatin fibers are organized as a left‐handed double helix twisted by repeating tetranucleosome units in an H1‐dependent manner. These results provide critical insights into fundamental structural aspects of the chromatin fiber and constitute an important step toward understanding of how chromatin fiber is organized and regulated.
Jijie Chai () is interested in mechanistic understanding of the nucleotide‐binding domain (NBD)‐ and leucine‐rich repeat (LRR)‐containing proteins (NLRs), which are crucial for the cytosolic immunosurveillance system of mammals.29, 30 NLRs function as pattern recognition receptors to perceive pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or host‐derived danger components. This results in the formation of high‐molecular‐weight complexes termed inflammasomes that activate the proinflammatory caspases‐1. Recognition of bacterial pathogens by NLR apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs) induces activation of NLR family CARD domain‐containing protein 4 (NLRC4) followed by formation of the NAIP‐NLRC4 inflammasomes.31, 32 Recent cryo‐EM studies33, 34 of the mouse Naip2‐Nlrc4 inflammasome provide the first view of how inflammasomes are assembled and activated (Table 2). In the cryo‐EM structures, the complex formed a wheel‐like architecture containing 10 or 11 Nlrc4 protomers; however, only one Naip2 molecule was incorporated into the complex. Structural comparison between an inactive Nlrc435 and the activated Nlrc4 suggests a model for the activation of the Naip2‐Nlrc4 inflammasome, in which Nlrc4, once activated by Naip2, exposes a previously hidden surface for interaction with a solvent‐exposed receptor surface of an inactive Nlrc4, leading to Nlrc4 self‐activation.
Yigong Shi has been working on intramembrane proteases since 2005. X‐ray crystallography was employed to solve the structures of the serine protease rhomboid and the zinc metalloprotease S2P.36, 37 The ultimate target is human γ‐secretase, which comprises the catalytic component presenilin and three additional membrane proteins. Human γ‐secretase is intricately linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and most AD‐derived missense mutations map to presenilin.38 Although the archeal homolog of presenilin was bagged by X‐ray crystallography,39 the intact γ‐secretase defied many years of crystallization attempt. The calculated molecular weight of γ‐secretase is only about 160 kDa, a challenging size for cryo‐EM analysis. Through a close collaboration between the Shi laboratory at Tsinghua and Xiaochen Bai and Sjors Scheres at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of MRC, the structure of γ‐secretase was determined at an overall resolution of 3.4 Å (Table 2).40 The vast majority of the side chains within the membrane exhibit unambiguous EM density for specific assignment. Atomic modeling of human γ‐secretase allows mechanistic understanding of functions and disease‐derived mutations.
Nieng Yan () seeks to elucidate the structural mechanism of the Na+ and Ca2+ channels in the excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling of skeletal and cardiac muscles, including the voltage‐gated Na+ and Ca2+ (Nav and Cav) channels and the ryanodine receptor RyRs.41 The Nav channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potential in excitable membranes. The action potential‐induced conformational changes of Cav1.1 activate RyR1, releasing Ca2+ from sarcoplasm into cytoplasm. In contrast, RyR2 is activated by the Cav1.2‐permeated Ca2+ influx, a mechanism known as calcium‐induced calcium release (CICR). Yan et al. determined the crystal structure of a bacterial Nav channel NavRh in a potentially inactivated state (Table 2).42 The homotetrameric NavRh exhibits asymmetry in the selectivity filter and the voltage‐sensing domains (VSDs) in the structure. Using cryo‐EM, Yan's group elucidated structures of the rabbit Cav1.1 channel complex at resolutions ranging from 4.3 to 3.6 Å.43, 44 The structures exhibit conformational shifts and reveal mechanistic insights into voltage‐dependent structural changes of the Cav channels. In collaboration with Yigong Shi and Sjors Scheres, Yan's group also determined the cryo‐EM structures of the rabbit RyR1 at near‐atomic resolutions in closed states and 5.7 Å resolution in the open state (Table 2).45, 46 The dilation of the cytoplasmic gate is induced by the conformational changes of the adjoining Central domain, which represents the major transducer in the long‐range allosteric gating of RyRs.46 These structures lay a solid foundation for mechanistic understanding of the E–C coupling and the function and disease mechanism of Nav and Cav channels.
Trained as an X‐ray crystallographer, Maojun Yang () began to use cryo‐EM to study membrane proteins since 2010. Mechanosensitive channels are unique membrane transporters that are activated by mechanical forces and transport specific molecules down a concentration gradient across a membrane. Mouse Piezo1 is the first mechanosensitive channel found in mammals47 and has broad functions in many physiological processes relating to mechanical forces. In close collaboration with Ning Gao and Bailong Xiao at Tsinghua, Yang determined the cryo‐EM structure of Piezo1 at 4.8 Å resolution (Table 2).48 In contrast to the prediction of a homotetramer, Piezo1 forms a trimeric propeller‐like structure, with three distal blades forming the extracellular domains and a central cap constituting the transmembrane domain which includes 42 transmembrane helices. This structure shed exciting new light on the functional mechanism of mechanosensitive channels.
In plant photosynthesis, a series of supramolecular machineries embedded in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast mediate the initial biochemical reactions driven by light energy. Among them, photosystem II (PSII) is the most upstream machinery capable of converting light energy and splitting water molecules under ambient temperature. PSII is powered by a series of peripheral light‐harvesting complexes termed LHCII. As a graduate student, Zhenfeng Liu () in the laboratory of Wenrui Chang () at the IBP solved the first X‐ray structure of plant major LHCII.49 However, little was known about how the LHCII complexes assemble with the PSII core complexes at specific locations, so as to deliver excitation energy efficiently. Through close collaborations with Xinzheng Zhang and Mei Li at the IBP, Liu determined the structure of spinach PSII–LHCII supercomplex at 3.2 Å resolution using single‐particle cryo‐EM (Table 2).50 This unveiled intricate innerworkings of a 1.1 MDa homodimeric supramolecular system containing 50 protein subunits, 210 chlorophylls, 56 carotenoids, and many other cofactors. The energy transfer pathways between three different LHCII complexes and the PSII core are suggested.
Ning Gao is interested in ribosome biogenesis and since 2008 has been employing cryo‐EM to study the dynamic ribosome assembly pathways51, 52 and the roles of various assembly factors.53, 54, 55 In particular, eukaryotic ribosome assembly is orchestrated by hundreds of auxiliary factors, making it an ideal system to fully explore the powerful potential of cryo‐EM. With the recent hardware and software breakthroughs in the field, Gao et al. have obtained a series of structures of the endogenous premature ribosomal particles isolated from yeast nuclei, and one specific state was solved at an overall resolution of 3.0 Å (Table 2).56 This structure enabled atomic modeling of over 20 assembly factors, which provide a structural framework for understanding the diverse roles of pre‐60S assembly factors. Gao also uses cryo‐EM as a primary tool to study the function of less‐characterized ribosome‐binding proteins in translation control, such as the ribosome‐associated cotranslational chaperones57 and heat‐shock‐induced ribosome‐splitting factor HflX.58
The genetic material DNA is first transcribed into precursor messenger RNA (pre‐mRNA) by eukaryotic RNA polymerase. Pre‐mRNA undergoes splicing by the spliceosome to generate mature mRNA, which is translated into protein by the ribosome. The spliceosome is a multi‐mega‐Dalton ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, with its components undergoing rapid flux during each cycle of pre‐mRNA splicing. Compared to the relatively stable structures of RNA polymerase and the ribosome (both determined by X‐ray crystallography), the spliceosome exhibits exceptional conformational flexibility and compositional dynamics. Relying on about 200,000 particles, the Shi laboratory determined the structure of an intact spliceosome from the yeast S. pombe at an overall resolution of 3.6 Å (Table 2).59, 60 This structure was followed up with near‐atomic cryo‐EM structures of the S. cerevisiae spliceosome at two distinct states of the pre‐mRNA splicing cycle.61, 62 Together with the structures of the U4/U6.U5 tri‐snRNP,63, 64 the molecular mechanisms of the yeast spliceosome are documented at unprecedented clarity.
One of the major focuses by Hong‐Wei Wang has been the structure and mechanism of macromolecules involved in RNA metabolism. He revealed the architecture of yeast RNA degradation exosome complex using single particle EM65 and later discovered the presence of two distinct routes within the complex for RNA substrate recruitment.66 In a recent study, Wang et al. pushed the resolution of the exosome complex to near‐atomic and discovered an interaction mode of Ski7 protein with the entire complex as well as structural elements involved in RNA substrate‐induced conformational switch of the complex.67 Wang et al. determined the architecture of human Dicer and RISC‐loading complex in the RNA interference pathway.68 Using the phase‐plate cryo‐EM technology, his group revealed the various conformational states of human Dicer induced by specific RNA substrates and cofactors (Table 2).69 He also solved the long‐sought structure of the group II intron RNA in complex with its intron‐encoded reverse transcriptase at near‐atomic resolution, which reveals the mechanism of intron self‐splicing and has implications for both the spliceosome and telomerase.70
Ye Xiang of Tsinghua University has been working on virus structures using a combination of X‐ray crystallography and cryo‐EM. The bacterial virus phi29 is an ∼15 MDa asymmetric complex system consisting of ∼9 components in different copies varying from several to several hundreds. Xiang used X‐ray crystallography to solve the structure of each individual component71, 72, 73, 74 and cryo‐EM to determine the structures of complex viral particles at different states (Table 2).74, 75 The ultimate goal is to obtain atomic details of the whole complex at different states, including the prohead, the mature virion, and the postinfection virion. Such structural information may help decipher the mechanisms of the viral capsid assembly, genome packaging, host cell recognition, host cell wall and membrane penetration, and genome release. Ping Zhu of IBP determined the cryo‐EM structures of a cypovirus virus (CPV) in its nontranscribing state at 3.9 Å resolution76 and in the transcribing state at 4.1 Å,77 which provide a detailed glimpse into the transcription process (Table 2). Fei Sun studied the structure of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) that belongs to Lagovirus, a branch of calicivirus. The cryo‐EM structure of RHDV was solved to 6.5 Å resolution with the core region at 5.5 Å, which enabled modeling of a semi atomic model and identification of the N‐terminal arm of the capsid protein that was unavailable in the crystal structure.78
Qinfen Zhang () of Sun Yat‐sen University has used cryo‐EM to analyze protein complexes79 as well as the icosahedral viruses that infect plant, fish, and crab.80 These studies yield clues for vaccine and medicine design. Although the structures of icosahedral viral capsids have been studied for about 50 years, the precise structures of genome and associated proteins within viral capsid remained unknown. Hongrong Liu () of Hunan Normal University and Lingpeng Cheng () of Tsinghua University collaborated to resolve this question using single‐particle cryo‐EM analysis in combination with their newly developed method for the symmetry‐mismatch reconstruction of icosahedral virus.81 The 3D structures of the dsRNA genome and the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerases were reconstructed within both transcribing and nontranscribing cypovirus capsid, revealing a dynamic process during virus transcription and challenging the conventional view on the packaging of dsRNA virus genomes inside the rigid capsid. Yao Cong () of the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology has focused on the protein folding nanomachine TRiC/CCT as well as virus–antibody complexes. In close collaboration with Zhong Huang at the Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Cong has resolved the near‐atomic resolution cryo‐EM structure of human enterovirus 71 (EV71) in complex with the Fab of a bivalent broadly neutralizing antibody.82 The Cong laboratory is also developing the sampling reduced FRM2D method to further accelerate the speed of image alignment.
The Chinese biological cryo‐EM community has expanded tremendously in the last decade, from a few independent laboratories in 2005 to more than 2 dozens in 2015 (Fig. 2). This remarkable expansion is paralleled by the timely procurement of advanced TEMs and fueled by the revolution in camera technology in recent years. There was no 200 kV cryo‐TEM with FEG in China in 2008; but 17 cryo‐TEMs with FEG were in service operating at 200 or 300 kV by the end of June 2016 (Table 1). The research output, as measured by publications in top‐notch journals, has increased drastically. Since 2014, 18 original research articles from China, each reporting the cryo‐EM structure of a biological macromolecule, were published in the global weekly journals Nature and Science (Table 2). Although cryo‐EM has also enjoyed a rapid and healthy growth in the other countries, the growth rate of cryo‐EM in China far exceeds that of the world average. This trend is expected to continue for an additional period of 5–10 years.
The development of biological EM in China is strongly tilted toward application, particularly single‐particle cryo‐EM analysis of supramolecular complexes, which brings an immediate and significant impact on the biological research community worldwide. The flip side of emphasizing application is reflected by apparent weakness in EM methodological development in China, which will likely restrict applications at the forefront of the EM field if left unaddressed. In addition, there is an ostensible paucity of research activity using cryo‐ET in China. These deficiencies would be tolerable for a small nation or a region, but not for a huge country like China that is motivated to play a key role in the evolving research field of biological EM. Thankfully, the Chinese biological cryo‐EM community has keenly recognized these shortcomings and is working hard to improve the situation.
Since its inception, X‐ray crystallography has played an instrumental role in our understanding of the biological world.83 Owing to its mature methodology, X‐ray crystallography has become a powerful, routine technology for nonspecialists and contributes to the vast majority of the detailed structural information in the protein data bank (PDB). There is no doubt that X‐ray crystallography will continue to play an important role in our quest to understand the microscopic world. But the relative roles of X‐ray crystallography versus EM have already changed and the trend of such changes is likely to accelerate in the coming years. In 2005, the weighted overall contribution to structural biology by cryo‐EM probably represented 1% of that by X‐ray crystallography; in 2015, the number was perhaps 80%. Although it is very difficult to predict the scenario in 2025, we would not be surprised if the relative contribution by these two methodologies reciprocates relative to that in 2005. Thankfully, those of us who used to rely exclusively on X‐ray crystallography are increasingly inclined to turn to EM for tackling research problems. We are optimistic that the biological EM community will greatly benefit from the joining of the X‐ray crystallography experts.
For the past two decades, pandemics of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) have been serious threats to global health, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Reassorted novel strains of influenza viruses and coronaviruses continue to arise, rendering vaccinations - if developed - less useful and posing increased risks to humans. Two prominent viruses – 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) – have markedly affected humans. H1N1, since the 2009 pandemic, has caused about 284,500 deaths, both directly via respiratory infections and indirectly from the cardiovascular diseases secondary to bacterial infections.1 In addition, MERS-CoV, since its first emergence in 2012, has infected 1600 individuals, causing 574 deaths and was reported in 26 countries although the vast majority of reported cases originated from the Arabian Peninsula.2
H1N1 and MERS-CoV both target the respiratory tract, and share many similar clinical symptoms. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat3-8 followed always by gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.3,7-9 Both diseases often lead to complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, organ failure, and even death.4,6,9 Complications mostly lie within the respiratory system with organ failure commonly noted in the respiratory system, followed by renal and cardiovascular systems.5 Individuals infected with H1N1 usually belong to those aged between 21 and 50 years,4,5 and have a mean age in the early 40s.3,5 MERS-CoV, on the other hand, mostly infects older adults with a median age of 50 years.10 This difference was hypothesized to be related to the development of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza viruses from previous exposures to seasonal influenza in elder people.5 Another difference between H1N1 and MERS-CoV relates to the length of the incubation period. H1N1 has a short incubation period between 1 and 2 days,11 whereas MERS-CoV has a much longer period of ~5 days.10
Many infected individuals exhibit comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and obesity), rendering them more susceptible to complications.3-7 Diabetes is one of the known documented contributing host-related risk factor in both H1N1 and MERS-CoV severe cases, and is frequent in individuals developing fatal disease complications.4-7 This observation may suggest an etiological relationship between diabetes and acute viral respiratory infections. Diabetes and its related conditions downregulate the innate and humoral immune systems by reducing the function of T cells and neutrophils.12 Hyperglycemia impairs critical components of innate immunity in vitro, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and the bactericidal activity of neutrophils and macrophages and lead to secondary infections.13 The direct influence of diabetes, however, on acute respiratory infections still needs more research to estimate the frequency of diabetes in severe viral conditions and to elucidate the etiologic role on diabetes in disease severity.14 The present study was undertaken to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature to describe the prevalence of diabetes in two of the emerging severe acute respiratory infections such as H1N1 and MERS-CoV and to explore its possible contribution to the severity and complication of the two viral conditions.
A search was conducted in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and Embase Classic databases to the last week of July 2015 using the search terms (MeSH) H1N1 or MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and Diabetes. The search resulted in 123 articles selected for title and abstract review as they satisfied our selection criteria (see below). We limited the studies into those in humans and excluded reports published as review articles, letters, case studies, editorials, conference abstracts, vaccination trials or family-based studies. After eliminating duplicate listings and only considering articles in full text, a total of 44 peer-reviewed original studies were selected for full text review. Full article review resulted in the further exclusion of 8 reports that were not documenting the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 or MERS-CoV (i.e., no association studies), examining only a small number of travellers as a case report (n=2 subjects), reporting seasonal influenza alone, reviewing already reported cases (MERS-CoV), or simply documenting national surveys. A bibliography search of the remaining articles identified two additional studies. A total of 38 peer- reviewed articles (29 studies for H1N13-5,14-39 and 9 for MERS-CoV6-9,40-44) were identified for this article (Figure 1).
The abstracts of the identified studies were independently reviewed by two readers (AB and SJ). Differences were resolved through discussions for a consensus to be reached. Percentage agreement and Cohen’s Kappa (k) statistic45 were calculated and interpreted in accordance with Landis and Koch’s benchmarks46 for assessing the agreement between reviewers as poor (<0), slight (0.0-0.20), fair (0.21-0.40), moderate (0.41-0.60), substantial (0.61-0.80), and excellent (0.81-1.0). The agreement on the inclusion between the two reviewers was 86%, with k=0.72 (95% CI 0.58-0.85).
The methodological quality of each study was evaluated as previously described47 with some modification. Quality of the study was based on four criteria: (a) the number of study subjects (n; at least the median of 157 for H1N1 and 17 for MERS-CoV), (b) comprehensive reporting of patients’ demographic information, (c) describing a minimum of 3 disease-associated symptoms and (d) reporting at least 2 comorbidities (in addition to diabetes). For each criterion, each study was given a score (0 or 1, with 1 fulfilling the criteria). The total score was calculated for each study (score range 0-4). Quality scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 were considered poor, fair, good and very good, respectively.
Data extracted from the selected studies included the first author’s name, publication date, country, dates of recruitment, ethnicity, total sample size (divided to males and females), age, prevalence of symptoms (including fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, APACHEII) and percentage of comorbidities at the time of presentation (including obesity, immunosuppression or HIV and heart conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and/or coronary arterial diseases) (Tables 1 and 2). Weighted average was used to calculate the average age and the overall prevalence of clinical symptoms and comorbidities. Publication bias was assessed both by the visual inspection of funnel plot (Figure 2) and by Egger’s test. Egger’s test is widely used to assess the tendency for the effects estimated in small sample size studies to differ from those estimated in larger studies. The results of Egger’s test are presented in terms of bias coefficient. To measure the prevalence of diabetes in the two viral conditions, we extracted the proportion of the disease in the reported cases of severe respiratory infections. A subgroup analysis was carried out by region, only for the H1N1 studies (Table 3). Region subgroup analysis for MERS-CoV was not doable since all the identified studies were conducted on Saudi populations, with one study of pooled analysis where region/country designation was not possible. The primary outcome measure was to evaluate the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases. The meta-analysis of proportions (and 95% CIs) was calculated for the identified studies (Figure 3) and in a subgroup analysis within each region (Table 3). Meta-analysis tests were conducted using the OpenMeta Analyst version 10.10, a free, cross-platform, open-source program.48 We used binary random-effects model since we assumed that the relationship between diabetes and severe respiratory infection is varied across populations. T-test was used to compare between average age in H1N1 and MERS-CoV since this factor was normally distributed in the two sets of studies. Mann-Whitney Utest was employed to compare the prevalence of clinical symptoms and comorbidities between the two diseases as these conditions were not normally distributed. To assess whether there is true heterogeneity among the selected studies and that all the studies are evaluating the same effect, we used the Q test.49
Q test only informs about the presence versus the absence of heterogeneity and does not report on the extent of such heterogeneity. Therefore, we calculated the I2 index to complement the Q test and quantify the degree of heterogeneity among studies.50 Given the poor power of Q test to detect true heterogeneity among a small number of studies, we also quantified the true heterogeneity by estimating the between-study variance in the random-effects model (τ2), as previously described.51 P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV severity from the selected studies and to inspect the heterogeneity of the individual findings.
data The present systematic review examines the relationship between diabetes and the H1N1 and MERS-CoV. A total of 38 studies that report the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 (n=92,948 cases from 29 studies, Table 1) and MERS-CoV (n=308 cases from 9 studies, Table 2) were selected. The funnel plot (Figure 2) demonstrated a non-symmetrical distribution of the effect size of each study on either side of the pooled estimate. This seemingly non-symmetrical appearance of the plot suggested evidence of publication bias. Egger’s test also supported this notion particularly in MERS-CoV studies where the bias coefficient was not statistically significant - given the assumption for evidence of small-study effects is based on P<0.1 (P=0.13 for the H1N1 studies and P=0.065 for the MERS-CoV studies). These findings are supported by the significant heterogeneity (P<0.001) among the selected studies (see below). According to our quality scoring criteria (see above), the majority of the studies were between fair (score 2; 12 reports) and good (score 3, 16 reports) quality with 7 studies that fulfilled all quality scoring criteria (score 4, very good). Within the selected studies, sex-ratio (male:female) in the majority of the H1N1 reports was 1:1 whereas it was ~2:1 in the MERS-CoV cases. The average age of H1N1 cases (36.2±6.0 years, range: 11-54.5 years) was significantly younger than MERS-CoV cases (54.3±7.4 years, range: 36-66 years, t-test P=0.0004). The prevalence of fever, shortness of breath, sore throat and cough was not statistically different between H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases from the two sets of studies (Mann-Whitney U test at P<0.05). We observed a non-statistically significant ~2-fold higher frequency of obesity (>30 kg/m2) in the MERS-CoV patients compared to their H1N1 counterparts (17.6±4.2 vs. 7.7±2.8%). The combined frequencies of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and cardio-artillery diseases were ~3-fold higher in MERS-CoV cases than in H1N1 (31.3±5.9% vs. 7.2±2.7, P=0.0004).
Meta-analyses for the proportion of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The overall proportion of diabetes in H1N1 is 15% (95% CI: 12-17%), 3.6-fold lower than its proportion in MERS-CoV (54%, 95%CI: 28-80%). The two sets of studies displayed a significant heterogeneity (P<0.001) among the selected studies (Q test: 1943 for H1N1 vs. 169.8 for MERS-CoV). Additionally, the degree of heterogeneity among studies was statistically significant (P<0.001) and comparable between the two sets of studies (I2 index: 98.6 for H1N1 vs. 95.3 for MERS-CoV). The between-study variance in the random-effects model was markedly lower among the H1N1 studies (τ2=0.003) than the MERS-CoV reports (τ2=0.134).
Subgroup analysis by region for H1N1 studies (Table 3) showed that the frequency of diabetes in H1N1 from Asia and North America (~18-20%, P<0.001) is 2-fold higher than its prevalence in the cases recruited from Europe and South America (~10%, P<0.001). Cases from Africa (14%) showed a non-significant slightly lower diabetes prevalence compared to those from Asia and North America. It should be noted however, that the frequency estimate from Africa was developed only from two studies (compared to 8 and 10 studies from Asia and North America, respectively, and 4 studies from each of Europe and South America). The heterogeneity tests for the studies included in all regional sub-analyses exhibited significant overall heterogeneity (Q test, P≤0.009), degree of heterogeneity among studies (I2 index) and between-study variance in the random-effects model (τ2 test).
The present systematic review evaluates the frequency of diabetes in SARI conditions such as H1N1 and MERS-CoV. We observed a large difference between the volume of literature and total number of subjects evaluated for each condition and identified 29 studies for H1N1 (with 92,948 subjects) and 9 for MERS-CoV (with 308 patients). About 60% of the selected studies (23 out of 38) had a quality score between good and very good (Tables 1 and 2). This indicates that a large set of the studies had a sufficient enough number subjects to substantiate the outcome and have provided a comprehensive reporting of patients’ demographic information. Furthermore, the majority of the selected studies reported a set of disease-associated symptoms and comorbidities that permitted developing a comprehensive profile of the infectious disease and its complication. This difference reflects the discrepancy between the two diseases in their global (H1N1) versus regional (MERS-CoV) spread, and the period during which they emerged. Immediately following its outbreak in 2009, the H1N1 triple reassortant swine influenza viruses contained genes from avian, swine, and human influenza A viruses53,54 and sustained a rapid between-human transmission to spread globally.52 On the other hand, in 2012, the emergence of MERS-CoV was to a great extent contained within the Arabian Peninsula55 and dromedary camels were identified as the intermediate host56 with a closely related virus sequences found in bats.57 Apart from a number of nosocomial outbreaks involving healthcare workers caring for MERS-CoV patients; little evidence has been initially reported for sustained person-to-person transmission.58 However, during the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea it was demonstrated that among 186 cases, 83.2% of the transmission events were linked to only 5 super-spreaders, all of whom had pneumonia at presentation and contacted hundreds of people, adding evidence to the person-to-person transmission in MERS-CoV.59
The characteristic pattern of transmission and spread of H1N1 and MERS-CoV may have resulted in a distinctive sex-ratio for each condition. MERS-CoV cases exhibited a sex-ratio (male:female) of 2:1, twice that noted for H1N1 cases (Tables 1 and 2). The male predominance of MERS-CoV reflects the higher likelihood of exposure to the infectious agent in males than in females in Middle Eastern cultures. In addition, most males who tested positive for the virus and died also had underlying medical conditions, which could explain the severity of cases in older males.60 In agreement, MERS-CoV cases were significantly older (54.3±7.4 years) than their H1N1 (36.2±6.0 years) counterparts. The average age of H1N1 patients is similar to that in H5N1 cases where 90 percent of the subjects were 40 years or younger.61 As noted with H5N1 cases, it can be estimated that 15-20% of elder people may have residual immunity against this H1N1 flu strain following their life-time exposures to multiple influenza outbreaks.61-64 This immunogenicity does not apply to coronaviruses and may explain the younger average age of H1N1 cases compared to MERS-CoV cases. Indeed, it was proposed over 60 years ago that repeated exposures to antigenic variants of influenza viruses may result in antibodies recognizing a large number of common flu antigens, and develop a reinforced immunity that lower the risk of infection with newly emerging variants.65
The clinical presentations of SARI generally include respiratory symptoms, such as fever, new onset or exacerbation of cough, breathing difficulty and sore throat. Severe illnesses may vary from pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, encephalitis, myocarditis, or other severe and life-threatening complications.66 The frequency of fever, shortness of breath, sore throat and cough was similar between H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases. In contrast, underlying medical conditions and comorbidities varied significantly between the two viral conditions. Patients with MERS-CoV had 2-fold higher rates of obesity (P>0.05) and 3-fold higher combined frequencies of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and cardio-artillery diseases (P<0.05) (Tables 1 and 2). The varying rates of comorbidities between H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases may relate to their different patterns of regional spread. Cardiovascular diseases are highly prevalent in the Middle East67 than in many regions of the world.67,68 This observation also applies to obesity, although the lower prevalence of obesity in males from the Arabian Peninsula versus females69 and their higher predominance in MERS-CoV patients (see above) together may have been combined to render the occurrence of obesity in MERS-CoV non-significantly different from that in H1N1. The increased risk of developing severe H1N1 and MERS-CoV complications in people with underlying chronic diseases was similarly reported in seasonal influenza. A recent study noted that, compared to subjects with no comorbidities, severe cases of influenza are more likely to manifest with obesity (OR for mortality 2.74, 95%CI: 1.56-4.80), cardiovascular diseases (2.92, 1.76-4.86), hypertension (1.49, 1.10-2.01) and neuromuscular disease (2.68, 1.91-3.75).70 More studies examining the link between SARI and metabolic syndrome-related complications such as obesity and cardiovascular conditions are needed to evaluate their contribution to the severity of infectious diseases.
The overall proportion of diabetes was ~4-fold higher in MERS-CoV cases (54%) than in their H1N1 counterparts (15%) (Figures 3 and 4). In agreement, odds ratio for severe H1N1 in diabetic subjects (ranging from 2.2 to 4.4)16,19,23,30 was >3-fold lower than for severe MERS-CoV (OR ranging from 7.2 to 15.7).9,40 Although at varying extents, these findings implicate diabetes as a risk factor for sever MERS-CoV and H1N1. One reason for this difference may relate to the higher average age of MERS-CoV cases given that older age is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes.71 Although in younger Middle Eastern populations rates of diabetes and its risk factors67 are higher than those in older populations, the disease prevalence has increased across all age groups rather than just in older adults in the region.72 Another possible explanation can be attributed to the high prevalence of diabetes in the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula67 - where MERS-CoV originated and spread - compared to its prevalence in other world regions.68 Similar increased rates of tuberculosis were noted in regions with high diabetes prevalence.73 Additionally, subgroup analysis by region demonstrated that diabetes frequency in H1N1 cases from Asia and North America is ~2-fold higher than in those from Europe and South America (Table 3). This coincides with the high prevalence of diabetes in Asia and North America (~12%) compared to Europe or South and Central America (~9%).74 However, despite the lines of evidence suggesting an influence of the region of viral spread on diabetes proportion in the severe cases of SARI, the rate of diabetes in MERS-CoV was still ~3-fold higher than that in the H1N1 cases from Asia (17.6%, 95% CI: 12.1-23.1; P<0.001; Table 3) - where diabetes rates are comparable to those in the regions of MERS-CoV. This observation suggests that the higher prevalence of diabetes in MERS-CoV cases than in H1N1, may not be simply related to the regional differences in the viral spread and that an etiologic role of diabetes in severe MERS-CoV cases may exist distinctive from that in H1N1.
Diabetes can impair the innate immune system75 and render individuals more susceptible to a range of infectious diseases and severe illnesses.13,75,76 For example, during seasonal influenza outbreaks, compared to healthy subjects, diabetic patients were shown to have 6-fold higher risk of becoming critically ill and acquire hospitalization with 4-fold increased rates of pneumonia-related hospitalizations and a 3-fold elevated likelihood of dying of complications.77 Diabetes share several common features with infectious disorders and its complication such as the endothelial dysfunction, the pro-inflammatory state and the attenuation of innate immune response.75 The cytokine overload related to the Th1 (microbicidal action of IFN- ) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory IL-4, -5, -10 and -13) shift in severe viral infection when accompanied by the increased cytokine levels arising from diabetes, both can be detrimental to the endothelium and lead to a range of subsequent complications.78 Dampened innate immunity and the shift from Th1 to Th2 responses were implicated in linking the high prevalence of allergy observed in fatal viral infections, e.g., Dengue fever.79 Furthermore, diabetes can impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions with a subsequent status of reduced immune response76 where individuals become at increased risk of severe infectious disease outcome. In support, diabetes-associated hyperglycemia and cellular insulinopenia are known to impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions with a subsequent status of reduced immune response.76 Furthermore, levels of HbA1c ≥9% were linked to a 60% increased risk of pneumonia-related complications and hospitalization due to a lower immune response.80 Host defense to infection is largely mediated by cellular immunity and the synthesis of related cytokines, such as IFN- and interleukins, is downregulated in diabetes.75,81
The present study has several limitations. Inspection of the funnel plot (Figure 2) and the Egger’s test indicates that publication bias may have been derived from the small-study effect, i.e., the possibility of including small studies with spuriously overstated estimates while ignoring those without statistically significant effects that may have a lower possibility of being published. Furthermore, the identified reports have shown 8-fold among-studies variance in the diabetes proportion for H1N1 (0.04-0.35; Figure 3) and MERS-CoV (0.1-0.8, Figure 4) cases. These inter-study differences may have contributed to the significant heterogeneity observed in our report. Additional sources of heterogeneity may relate to the large variation among studies in the sample size (19 to 70,000 H1N1 cases and 5 to 161 MERS-CoV patients) or the ethnic diversity of the study populations particularly within the H1N1 studies (collected from 14 counties). Furthermore, heterogeneous methodologies due to different study designs may have influenced the inter-study variation. This observation may levy some limitations on the estimated contribution of diabetes to severe H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases and render our results as a guide to generate more accurate estimates for national or international intervention strategies for severe SARI conditions in diabetic subjects. Furthermore, although the prevalence of diabetes is 15% in severe H1N1 cases and 54% in MERS-CoV, it may not implicate causality and warrants further studies to identify the nature and extent of the coexistence between diabetes and each of the two respiratory infections. Another limitation is the low number of MERS-CoV cases and the narrow geographic region from which it was recruited, compared to the H1N1 cases that rendered subgroup analysis (by region) unattainable for MERS-CoV cases. This particular limitation may add more weight to the suggestion stipulating that the difference in diabetes prevalence between H1N1 and MERS-CoV can be attributable to the regional difference in spread. The small number of MERS-CoV studies highlights the need to develop international collaborations that include cases from countries other than those in the Arabian Peninsula, e.g., from Korea where a few recent cases have been emerged recently. A single study44 has examined MERS-CoV cases pooled from various countries but the findings were still limited by the small population size. The reports identified in the present study did not distinguish between the prevalence of type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes in H1N1 or MERS-CoV cases. With the exception of three studies (only in the H1N1 - but not MERS-CoV),14,17,35 all the identified reports have combined both types of diabetes despite their different characteristics, etiological factors and clinical features. Cortes Garcia et al.,14 and Koegelenberg et al.,35 have clearly stated that the diabetic cases in their H1N1 series as type 2 cases. Jimenez-Garcia et al.,17 on the other hand, compared the demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions and in-hospital case fatality risk (CFR) in the type 1 (prevalence 0.8%) and type 2 (prevalence 8.4%) diabetic patients and reported a ~2-fold higher CFR in type 2 cases than type 1.17 Given this paucity of information, it was challenging to distinguish between the two types of diabetes for their role in viral disease severity and complication.
In conclusion, the present study provides some evidence of a greater prevalence of diabetes to MERS-CoV severity compared to H1N1. If this relationship is causal, however, the substantial proportion of diabetes in each of the two infections suggests that introducing effective strategies for diabetes prevention may reduce the severity of a significant number of SARI conditions. Specific systematic vaccination intervention strategies against SARI diseases should be also considered for patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular conditions.82 This should be viewed as a key public health strategy in preventing SARI-associated morbidity and mortality.83 During the 1957–58 pandemic and in response to substantial morbidity and mortality, the US Surgeon General recommended annual influenza vaccination for individuals with chronic debilitating disease, people aged ≥65 years and pregnant women.84 For these high-risk groups, the first recommendation of national universal seasonal influenza vaccination was established in 2010 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).85 Recently, influenza vaccination was demonstrated to be associated with preventing allcause hospitalization in infected subjects.86 However, despite numerous recommendations from several public health organizations across the world (e.g., CDC, WHO, etc.) to administer SARI vaccines (e.g., influenza) annually to diabetic patients, vaccination rate in this vulnerable sub-population remains low.87-89 The current level of vaccination falls far short of the 2010 national health objectives call for a 90% rate to all elderly people (≥65 years of age) and 60% for younger people who have risk factors (e.g., diabetes).88 The prevalence of chronic diseases is rising in middle- and low-income countries as populations age and lifestyles and diets change. Further studies are being undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of other comorbidities in H1N1 and MERS-CoV. Subsequent introduction of effective public health vaccination intervention approaches and strategies is necessary to improve the protection against SARI in subjects with chronic disorders such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular conditions.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV are two closely related zoonotic coronaviruses. Both have successfully crossed the species barrier to allow animal-to-human transmission, and further to allow human-to-human transmission (Song et al. 2005; Reusken et al. 2016). The SARS outbreak in 2003 had a mortality rate of 10% (Anderson et al. 2010), and SARS-CoV was considered the most aggressive coronavirus compared to other human coronaviruses that commonly cause mild to moderate infection in their hosts (van der Hoek 2007). MERS-CoV is the cause of an ongoing outbreak of the respiratory illness MERS (de Groot et al. 2013). At the time of writing, 1791 MERS cases have been confirmed with a mortality rate of approximately 35% (World Health Organization 2016). Both MERS and SARS have higher mortality rates in elderly and immunosuppressed populations (Gralinski and Baric 2015).
The host changes by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV suggest that other coronaviruses can potentially cross the species barrier, become zoonotic, and enable human-to-human transmission, ultimately causing high morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV exploited mechanistically different approaches to overcome the human species barrier, but these two viruses have a lot in common (Lu et al. 2015). Here, we aim to identify the vulnerable regions in the proteomes of coronaviruses that neither SARS-CoV nor MERS-CoV nor their contemporary and forthcoming relatives can proliferate without, and address how to mobilize a defense against the present and future coronaviruses by targeting these regions.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are positive (+)-strand RNA viruses encoding approximately 25 protein products. The MERS-CoV proteome is primarily composed of two polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1ab; the latter is generated by a -1 ribosomal slippage frameshift. These proteins are cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs). NSPs 1–10 are products of both polyproteins, whereas NSPs 12–16 are only yielded by ORF1ab. NSP11 is unique to ORF1a (van Boheemen et al. 2012). Structural proteins envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) are elements of the physical structure that encloses the viral genome and come from distinct reading frames, unlike ORF1a and ORF1ab, which come from overlapping reading frames. Additionally, the structural proteins are the product of subgenomic mRNAs that are joined during discontinuous negative RNA strand synthesis (van Boheemen et al. 2012). Finally, NS3 protein (NS3), NS4A protein (NS4A), NS4B protein (NS4B), NS5 protein (NS5), and Orf8b protein encompass the remainder of the proteome and also arise from distinct reading frames (van Boheemen et al. 2012).
Our approach utilizes genomic sequence data, which is readily available for viruses known to cause disease. However, because most viruses pose no major threat to their host, they pass by unnoticed leaving the majority of virus genome space uncharted. With the availability of cost-efficient genome sequencing technology, and recent developments in the field of viral metagenomics, large-scale identification of viral genome space is on the rise (Rosario and Breitbart 2011; Mokili et al. 2012). By exploring viral diversity, critical components constituting a viral genus’ fitness can be evaluated. Examples such as the common influenza virus illustrate the rapidity of viral gene mutation and in order to maintain immune protection, an annual flu vaccination is recommended. Underway efforts aim to generate broadly neutralizing vaccines whose design accounts for the genomic sequences of multiple types of influenza virus to eliminate frequent re-vaccination against the flu (Giles and Ross 2011, 2012). Development of broadly neutralizing vaccines often relies on the consensus or ancestral sequences of extant viral sequences in order to provide greater coverage for related viruses (Kesturu et al. 2006). Unfortunately, consensus sequences can be misleading, and ancestral sequence reconstruction is error-prone for quickly diverging sequences (McCloskey et al. 2014). In addition, viruses with compact genomes often express proteins with structural disorder that may undergo structural transformations. Although these transformer proteins, like VP40 in Ebola, are masters at changing their structure, and thus expanding their functional repertoire as needed for the life cycle of the virus (Bornholdt et al. 2013), flexible regions are potentially important in rewiring protein–protein interactions between the virus and its host (Le Breton et al. 2011; Ortiz et al. 2013; Gitlin et al. 2014). The flexibility trait of many viral proteins is a complicating factor in vaccine development. For instance, Dengue virus exhibits serotype-specific antibody affinity that causes antibody-dependent enhancement, an obstacle in the development of Dengue vaccines that protects against all four serotypes (Flipse and Smit 2015). To overcome the hurdle posed by structural flexibility, we propose an additional screening step in identifying potential vaccine or antiviral targets that considers the structural flexibility of the viral proteins. The Structural Genomics Initiatives increased their success rate by excluding proteins predicted to be structurally disordered (Slabinski et al. 2007). A similar approach can perhaps benefit vaccine development. Furthermore, to make this approach robust to potential mutations, minimizing loss in efficacy or resistance, the evolutionary context of sequence and structure must be considered. Thus, we suggest expanding the concept of broadly neutralizing vaccines/antivirals by increasing the diversity of viruses considered if possible. Sites conserved for sequence, structure, and with low disorder propensity among diverse virus protein homologs are very likely to be constrained from 1) changing sequence on evolutionary time scales and 2) undergoing real-time structural transitions. These sites have potential as targets for broad-specificity antivirals or vaccines because conservation makes them broad-specificity and low dynamics avoids targeting a conformational ensemble, which is not only difficult (Yu et al. 2016), but that may change as the sequence diverges (Siltberg-Liberles et al. 2011).
A recent large-scale study of structural disorder in >2,000 viral genomes in 41 viral families found the amount of disorder in different virus families varying from 2.9% to 23.1% (Pushker et al. 2013). It was reported that Coronaviridae has very low disorder content (mean disorder 3.68%) (Pushker et al. 2013). Coronaviridae contains two subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are part the Coronavirinae subfamily, from here on referred to as coronavirus (CoV). The lack of disorder is intriguing because it may be important for rewiring interactions between viral proteins and host proteins (Ortiz et al. 2013) and providing opportunities to acquire novel functional sequence motifs (Gitlin et al. 2014). Structural disorder has also been proposed to be important for viral viability, enabling multifunctionality and vigor in response to changes in the environment (Xue et al. 2014). Given the low fraction of structural disorder reported across Coronaviridae, we set out to investigate the conservation of structural disorder and secondary structure across CoV. Sites identified as conserved for structure and lacking disorder can be considered to be vulnerable and druggable in the proteomes of coronaviruses. The structural divergence capacity of these regions is limited, leaving a wider range of the present and emergent coronaviruses susceptible to the effects of potential broadly neutralizing anti-CoV therapies targeting these sites. We will refer to these sites as target sites.
Protein sequences were identified by individual BLAST searches with MERS-CoV (Taxonomy ID: 1335626) proteins ORF1ab (YP_009047202.1; polyprotein), S protein (YP_009047204.1), M protein (YP_009047210.1), E protein (YP_009047209.1), and N protein (YP_009047211.1) against coronaviruses. BLAST searches of the ORF1ab protein were performed, using start and end positions as detailed in the ORF1ab NCBI Reference Sequence file, against the refseq_protein database. The sequences retrieved from the BLAST output maintained the following cutoff: >30% sequence identity and >50% coverage relative to MERS-CoV sequence query. The 30% sequence identity and 50% query coverage cutoff strikes a balance between alignment quality and at least 10 sequences for most protein families. NSP1 (YP_009047202.1; 1-193), NSP2 (YP_009047202.1; 194-853), NS3 (YP_009047205.1), NS4A (YP_009047206.1), NS4B (YP_009047207.1), NS5 (YP_009047208.1), ORF8b protein (YP_009047212.1), and NSP11 (YP_009047203.1; 4378-4391) are not included in this study due to <10 BLAST hits.
Multiple sequence alignments were constructed for the selected BLAST hits using MAFFT (Katoh et al. 2002). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MrBayes 3.2.2 with a four category gamma distribution and the mixed model for amino acid substitution (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003). Each tree ran for five million generations, with a sample frequency of 100. The final tree was constructed from the last 75% of samples, discarding the first 25% of samples as the default burnin, and using the half-compatible parameter, to avoid weakly supported nodes (i.e., with a posterior probability <0.5). All trees were midpoint rooted.
For every protein family, the amino acid substitution rate per site in its multiple sequence alignment was calculated using empirical Bayesian estimation as implemented in Rate4Site (Mayrose et al. 2004). Substitution rates were calculated using 16 gamma categories, the JTT substitution matrix (Jones et al. 1992), and the reconstructed phylogenies. The rates were normalized per protein family with an average across all sites equal to zero and SD equal to 1. This means that sites with a rate <0 are evolving slower than average, whereas sites with a rate >0 are evolving faster than average.
Intrinsic disorder propensity was inferred using two different predictors: IUPred (default settings; “long” option) (Dosztányi et al. 2005a, 2005b) and DISOPRED2 (Ward et al. 2004) for all proteins. For IUPred, the site-specific continuous disorder propensities for each protein were mapped onto their corresponding position in the multiple sequence alignment as raw disorder propensities and as binary states, order or disorder, using two cutoffs of 0.4 and 0.5. Disorder propensities below the cutoff were assigned order and disorder propensities at the cutoff or above were assigned disorder. For the DISOPRED2 predictions that were inferred using the nr database, the continuous disorder propensities for every site in a protein were mapped onto their corresponding position in the multiple sequence alignment as raw disorder propensities and as binary states, order or disorder, using a cutoff of 5. Consequently, for every protein family (a multiple sequence alignment and its corresponding phylogenetic tree), two continuous matrices and three binary matrices resulted: IUPred 0.4, IUPred 0.5, and DISOPRED2. An additional matrix was generated to indicate sites where the binary order and disorder assignments differ between IUPred 0.4 and DISOPRED2.
A similar methodology was employed to analyze secondary structure predicted by PSIPRED (McGuffin et al. 2000) and JPred (Drozdetskiy et al. 2015). For both predictors, the uniref90 database was used and sites were classified as loops, alpha helices, or beta strands and mapped back onto their corresponding sites in the multiple sequence alignment. This resulted in two three-state matrices for each protein family alignment, one for each predictor, and two binary matrices displaying secondary structure elements (alpha helix and beta strand) or loops. An additional matrix was generated to indicate sites where the secondary structure assignments differ between PSIPRED and JPred.
For every protein family, the binary matrices resulting from the different disorder predictions and from the different secondary structure predictions were analyzed in the corresponding evolutionary context using GLOOME. GLOOME (Gain-Loss Mapping Engine) analyzes binary presence and absence patterns in a phylogenetic context (Cohen et al. 2010). In this study, the Rate4Site option in GLOOME was used to analyze the binary matrices (IUPred 0.4, IUPred 0.5, DISOPRED2, PSIPRED, and JPred) with the corresponding phylogenetic trees to map change of state across sites in each individual protein phylogeny (Cohen and Pupko 2010; Cohen et al. 2010). GLOOME was run with 16 gamma categories and a substitution matrix set to equal rates within each state and transitions between states treated equally. From the binary disorder and order matrices, transition rates between disorder and order or vice versa (DOT) were estimated. From the binary structure and loop matrices, transition rates between structure and loop or vice versa (SLT) were estimated. Similar to Rate4Site, the rates were normalized per protein family with an average across all sites equal to zero and SD equal to 1. This means that sites with a rate <0 are evolving slower than average, while sites with a rate >0 are evolving faster than average.
Protein families were visualized in an integrative manner with a phylogenetic tree, any matrix (multiple sequence alignment or predictor based) displayed as a heatmap, and site-specific sequence transition rates using Python packages ETE3 (Huerta-Cepas et al. 2016) and Matplotlib (Hunter 2007).
Amino acid evolutionary rates (SEQ) for all sites across all alignments were aggregated and binned into four possible categories characterized by the distribution of PSIPRED predicted secondary structure at each site. Sites predicted to have a loop across all sequences are “conserved loops; C(L)” and sites predicted to have a helix across all sequences or a strand across all sequences are “conserved helix-strand; C(HS)” (table 3). Sites predicted to have all three states (helix, strand, and loop) or any combination of loop and one other state are “non-conserved helix, loop, strand; NC(HLS)” and sites predicted to have a mixture of helix and strand are “non-conserved helix-strand; NC(HS)” (table 3). In all cases, gaps were ignored when classifying combinations of secondary structure at a site or if secondary structure conservation exists at a particular site.
Phylogenies were built for all protein products encoded in the MERS-CoV single-stranded RNA genome, except for NSP1, NSP2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, ORF8b protein, and NSP11, all of which had insufficient sequence data (<10 sequence hits with BLAST).
NSP12 is often used as a measure for newly identified coronaviruses. According to the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses, a major criterion in determining if a coronavirus is considered novel is pairwise sequence identity below 90% for NSP12 in all comparisons to previously known coronaviruses (Bermingham et al. 2012). Four main clades, alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus (fig. 1), are identified in agreement with the taxonomic classifications described by the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2015). Coronaviruses not listed by the ICTV are assumed to be a part of the clade in which representatives with known classifications are situated in our NSP12 phylogeny.
